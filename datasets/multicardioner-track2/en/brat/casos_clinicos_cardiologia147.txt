Clinical history and current illness
A 67-year-old man consulted for a clinical picture of approximately two months of episodes of self-limited palpitations lasting seconds, which started and ended spontaneously, in several episodes during the day, with a greater predominance at rest. Reason for consultation: tiredness and palpitations. Personal history: no relevant medical history. Smoker of one or two cigarettes a week. Family history: sudden death of his paternal grandfather at the age of forty, his father died at the age of 58 during post-operative throat surgery for an unclear cause. She does not take any regular pharmacological treatment.

Present illness: a 67-year-old man consulted for a clinical picture of approximately two months of episodes of self-limited palpitations lasting seconds, which begin and end spontaneously, in several episodes during the day, with a greater predominance at rest. At the same time of evolution he presents deterioration of his functional class with dyspnoea on moderate exertion. She denies chest pain or syncopal episodes.  

Complementary tests
- Blood tests: normal haemogram and biochemistry.
- ECG: sinus, ventricular extrasystoles with LBBB morphology and inferior axis (positive QRS DII, III aVF and negative QRS aVL). Late depolarisation wave in V1.
- Holter ECG/24 hours: sinus rhythm. Isolated supraventricular extrasystoles without significant association. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles with several doublets, phases of bigeminy and episode of NSVT. Tendency to nocturnal sinus bradycardia. No significant pauses. N. Ventricular extrasystoles 8572/24 hours.
- TT echocardiogram: LVEF: 59%, LVEDD 54 mm, LA 54 mm, IVS 11 mm, right ventricle in M mode in long axis: 36 mm. Saccular images on free wall with slightly decreased systolic function. No valvular heart disease. No pericardial effusion.
- Cardiac MRI: functional examination is performed using ECO T2 gradient CINE sequences with cardiac synchronisation. Performed after contrast administration. Late enhancement examination: left atrial dilatation. Left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved LVEF 66%. Dilated right ventricle IVTD 121 ml/m2, IVTS 67 ml/m2 with moderate-severe depression of RV systolic function EF 33%. Akinetic aneurysmal sacculations in the right ventricular free wall.

Clinical course
Treatment with sotalol was started with adequate tolerance and reduction of symptoms. An exercise test was performed under pharmacological treatment in which he remained asymptomatic, doubling the DP. Ventricular extrasystoles were observed at rest, which disappeared on exertion. No other arrhythmias were observed. The patient continued to be monitored in outpatient consultations and was found to be asymptomatic and with improvement in his functional class.

Diagnosis
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle.
