Clinical history and current illness
47-year-old male admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for dyspnoea and febrile syndrome. No drug allergies. Ex-ADVP. Smoker. HIV C-3 infection on triple antiretroviral therapy until two months ago with good adherence to ART but not attending check-ups. Oesophageal candidiasis. Castlemann's disease diagnosed in 2006, completing chemotherapy treatment with good evolution. Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosed in September 2007 with chemotherapy treatment. Bacteremic pneumonia due to Acinetobacter baumanii in September 2007.
Chronic hepatopathy due to HCV without previous decompensation. Sporadic use of inhaled cocaine and cannabis, no injecting drug use. A few months ago, he reported a traffic accident with the death of two close relatives, as a result of which he abandoned his usual treatment and started taking drugs (intravenous cocaine and smoked heroin).
Treatment: methadone (25-0-25) and atripla.
The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department for symptoms that started approximately 30 days ago, which debuted as a cough with expectoration that was initially mucopurulent and later rusty. Chest pain that was exacerbated by coughing and inspiration, partially relieved by trunk flexion. Progressive dyspnoea, initially on exertion until becoming resting dyspnoea in the last ten days, with orthopnoea and episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Dysthermic sensation with a maximum thermometric fever of 39oC. In view of the clinical manifestations, the Cardiology Service was requested to assess the patient.

Complementary tests
- Physical examination: BP 80/45mmHg, HR 115 bpm, satO2 95% baseline, afebrile. Conscious and oriented. Cachectic, with good peripheral perfusion. Tachypneic at rest. Multiple venipuncture sites. Jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation rhythmic and without murmurs. Conservative vesicular murmur. Soft and depressible abdomen, large hepatomegaly, oedema in the lower extremities and trophic skin lesions.
- ECG: sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, axis at 90o, narrow QRS without repolarisation alterations.
- CBC: urea and Cr normal. Na 126, K normal. Hb 10.3 g/dL, leukocytes 16,800 (N 70.2%), platelets 253,000. IP 69%, INR 1.29, APTT 34.7.
- Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly, condensation in the right pulmonary base.
- Echocardiogram: normal LV with preserved global and segmental systolic function. RV not dilated and with preserved systolic function. No valvulopathies. No stigmata of endocarditis. Severe pericardial effusion, enveloping, about 5 cm with signs of tamponade.


Clinical course
The echocardiogram showed severe pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade, so evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed by subxiphoid access draining 1000 ml of purulent fluid. Gram staining of the fluid showed gram + cocci in chains, and the culture was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Blood cultures were negative and pneumococcal antigen positive in urine. Antibiotic treatment was started with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. A control echocardiogram was performed, showing that the pericardial effusion had practically resolved, with a minimal amount of fluid remaining in the posterior sac. There were no signs of haemodynamic compromise (no cavitary collapse or respirophasic variations).
In a situation of clinical stability, the patient was discharged to the hospital ward for follow-up. Days later, he presented a new clinical and haemodynamic worsening. He was tachycardic and tachypneic, with a tendency to arterial hypotension. The echocardiogram showed severe pericardial effusion and a new evacuating pericardiocentesis was performed, aspirating 250 ml of purulent liquid and leaving him connected to drainage with aspiration with a total debit of 1200 ml in 48 hours.

Diagnosis
Pneumococcal purulent pericarditis complicated with cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis.
