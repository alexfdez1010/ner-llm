70-year-old male, with no cardiovascular risk factors or relevant medical history. He leads an active life. He presented with an episode of dyspnoea on exertion lasting two days, denying chest pain and palpitations.

History, current illness and physical examination
Physical examination revealed low-set ears, broad nasal bridge and neck, low hairline, pectus carinatum/excavatum and scoliosis. No jugular ingurgitation. Multifocal III/VI systolic murmur, of greater intensity in the sternal notch, without irradiation. Pulmonary auscultation was normal. Peripheral pulses were symmetrical. There was no oedema.

Complementary tests
- Electrocardiogram: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and signs of right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Echocardiogram: Despite a poor window, a very hypertrophic right ventricle was seen, with thickening of the tricuspid valve.
- Transesophageal echocardiogram: This was performed and showed dilatation of the pulmonary artery, with no further data with respect to the transthoracic echocardiogram.
- CT scan: Given the suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, a CT scan was performed to rule out secondary causes, the most relevant finding being an aneurysmal dilatation of the main pulmonary artery (4.3 cm) and left pulmonary artery (3.8 cm).
- Cardiac MRI: Thickening of the pulmonary valve was observed, with accelerated flow, suggestive of severe pulmonary stenosis.
- Catheterisation: Right catheterisation was performed and ventriculography confirmed pulmonary valve stenosis and another infundibular stenosis, with a gradient between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of 70 mmHg and 42% with spectral Doppler and DTI in the bordeline range in the 1st and normal in the 2nd. Minimal IT with gradient of 22 mmHg and PAPs of 30 mmHg. LV 45 mm with very discrete inferobasal hypokinesia and overall preserved EF (50-55%).

Clinical evolution
Percutaneous dilatation of the pulmonary valve was performed, reducing the transvalvular gradient to 30 mmHg, leaving moderate pulmonary insufficiency; the subvalvular gradient was 60 mmHg, so he is receiving high doses of metoprolol (250 mg c/12 hours), with good tolerance, maintaining heart rate around 65-70 beats per minute.

Diagnosis
Noonan syndrome.
