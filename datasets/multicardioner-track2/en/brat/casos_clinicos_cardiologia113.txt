Male patient aged 16 years, youth footballer. He was involved in competitive sports, with a personal history of chickenpox, no known allergies or history of surgery. He was in good health and did not regularly take drugs or have toxic habits.

History, current illness and physical examination
Clinical picture characterised by oppressive central thoracic pain, sometimes referred to as stabbing, non-radiating, which appeared at rest and did not change with exertion and lasted one hour. The pain increased with inspiration and when sitting down. He denied vegetative cortex, dyspnoea, palpitations or syncope. He was referred by his primary care physician to the emergency department of our hospital, where he arrived asymptomatic. On taking the medical history, he reported that two days ago he presented with a self-limited episode of diffuse abdominal pain and vomiting of food, in the context of nine days of diarrhoeic stools, without pathological products, and afebrile at all times.

Physical examination:
BP: 120/60 mmHg HR 80x" FR: 18x". Alert, conscious, oriented, hydrated and afebrile. Head and neck: Oropharyngeal: No pathological findings. No jugular ingurgitation at 45°. AC: Rhythmic heart sounds at 80x ́. No pericardial friction rub. AP: Normal respiratory sounds. Abdomen: Soft, non-painful, without masses or visceromegaly and with peristalsis present. LES: No oedema and normal pulses.

Complementary tests
- ECG: On admission.

- Analysis on the cardiology ward: Haemogram: Hb 16.4 g/dL; Hct 46%; leukocytes 9.2 mil/mm3 (normal formula); platelets 217 mil/mm3.
- Biochemistry: basal glucose 84 mg/dl; HbA1c 5.1%; urea 0.29 g/L; creatinine 1.0 mg/dl; total cholesterol 82 mg/dl; triglycerides 110 mg/dl; HDL-c 25 mg/dL; LDL-c 35 mg/dL; AST 16 U/L; ALT 14 U/L; GGT 16 U/L; LDH 223 U/L; sodium 143 mEq/L; potassium 4.3 mEq/L.
- Myocardial damage markers: maximum Troponin I 25 ng/ml. Maximum CK (in 1st determination in the ER 346 U/L, normal up to 270), maximum CK-MB 36 U/L.
- Serology: Negative for HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, HSV, VZV, enterovirus and parvovirus B19.
- Transthoracic echocardiogram (initial): Left atrium not dilated. Thin leaflet mitral valve with preserved mobility and opening; normal diastolic flow. Left ventricle neither dilated nor hypertrophied with preserved systolic function and no segmental asymmetries; false tendons and papillary muscles very evident. Fine, trivalve aortic valve with normal opening, mobility and flow. Aortic root not dilated. Right chambers not dilated; right ventricular contractility preserved. Tricuspid valve correctly implanted, fine with good mobility and opening. Fine pulmonary valve with normal opening and flow. No pericardial effusion. LVEF 64% Conclusions: No pathological alterations.
- ECG at discharge: Sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. Normal PR. No intraventricular conduction block. Slight concave ST supradelevation upwards of 1 mm in II, III and aVF. Normal QT.
- Cardiac MRI: LV diameter and volumes within normal limits for sex, age and body surface area. Global LV function preserved, without segmental alterations. Normal LV mass. Normal RV volumes and function. No segmental alterations.
- T2 spin-echo sequences: No significant oedema.
- Gadolinium with inversion-recovery sequences: Late subepicardial linear enhancement at basal and inferobasal anterior septum level.
- Conclusions: Subacute myopericarditis
- Holter ECG study (Cardiology consultation): Sinus rhythm throughout the recording. No significant rhythm alterations detected.
- Stress test (Cardiology consultation): Asymptomatic throughout the test. Exercise time 12 minutes of Bruce protocol. The test was stopped on completing the 4th stage, reaching 93% of the maximum theoretical heart rate and a double product of 2.9. No acute repolarisation disturbances. Basal sinus tachycardia. No ventricular arrhythmias detected.

Clinical evolution
Admitted to the cardiology ward with a diagnosis of myopericarditis. He was under continuous electrocardiographic monitoring with no conduction disturbances or supra- or ventricular arrhythmias. During admission he remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view, with no signs of heart failure. Serial echocardiograms were performed during admission, with no evidence of deterioration in systolic function. Given the good evolution, the patient was discharged home, indicating limitation of physical activity, and an appointment was made with the outpatient cardiology department.
At the first follow-up appointment, the patient was asymptomatic and a cardiac magnetic resonance report was received confirming the diagnosis. In addition, after three months, an ECG holter was performed, which was reported with no alterations, as well as conventional ergometry where he completed the 4th Bruce stage, with no alterations. Subsequent check-ups were uneventful. At present, more than twelve months after diagnosis, the patient is asymptomatic and is involved in competitive physical activity.

Diagnosis
Acute myopericarditis.
