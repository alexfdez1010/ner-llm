A 30-year-old man with a smoking rate of 10 packs/year; he began his illness 3 months previously with the presence of asthenia, adynamia, general malaise, diaphoresis, predominantly at night, and weight loss of 12 kg; subsequently, indurated, erythematous, slightly painful lesions appeared on the middle finger and first left eye, and fever. Physical examination revealed: fever, caries in the upper second molar and presence of lower dental plaque, systolic I/IV murmur radiating to the neck vessels and diastolic II/IV in the aortic focus, bounding pulse, Lyan's sign and femoral shot, increased volume and redness on the second phalange of the right hand finger; labs showed haemoglobin 13 g/dL, leukocytes 9,200/mm3, neutrophils 83%, lymphocytes 13%, platelets 320,000/mm3, glucose 121 mg/dL, ESR 46 mm/h and Creactive protein 5.1 mg/dL. The chest X-ray showed grade I cardiomegaly and the echocardiogram showed a calcified aorta with a slightly reduced valve opening (2.3 cm2), with masses on the leaflets of very mobile low reflectance, suggesting vegetations that condition moderate to severe insufficiency. Blood culture isolated streptococcus viridans on 3 occasions.
