HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

We present a 49-year-old male, with no previous allergies, who consulted the emergency department for a condition compatible with an allergic reaction.

History
Cardiovascular risk factors: smoker of 15 cigarettes a day. No hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidaemia. No known cardiological history.
As other history, he is diagnosed with moderate COPD: spirometry: FVC 3.27 L ( 68 %) FEV1 1.90 l ( 51 %), FEV1 % 58 % moderate obstructive disorder. Volumes: TGV 5.51 L (147 %), TLC 8.44 L (116 %), RV 4.76 L (204 %) RV/TLC 56 %). Hyperinflation with air trapping. DLCO 27/88 (91 %). Chronic treatment with inhalers: tiotropium 1 inhalation every 24 hours, budesonide/formoterol 1 inhalation every 12 hours and salbutamol on demand.

Present illness
Patient suffers a casual fall, hitting his side and right arm, and decides to take the usual analgesia (Nolotil). He then began to experience pruritus, generalised rash and very intense dyspnoea. He was taken by ambulance to the hospital emergency room.
The patient arrived at the ED with great difficulty in breathing, so immediate treatment with corticosteroids, salbutamol and antihistamines was started, with significant improvement in clinical symptoms and oxygen saturation.
When the patient was able to speak (after improvement of his dyspnoea), he reported having started with chest pain of intensity 10/10 and an ECG was performed.

Physical examination
Afebrile (36.8°C). BP 135/90, HR 80, eupneic (after treatment), rash on face and trunk. AC: RsCsRs without murmurs AP: VCM, some isolated expiratory wheezing (after treatment). Abdomen soft, non-painful, without masses or megaliths. EEEII without oedema and with positive paedial pulses.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Laboratory tests on admission: biochemistry: glucose 202 mg/dl, urea 25 mg/dl, creatinine 0.87 mg/dl, sodium ion 140 mmol/l 136 - 145, alanine aminotransferase 8 U/l, total bilirubin < 1.0 mg/dl. CBC: red blood cells 4.78 x10^6/μL, haemoglobin 16.7 g/dl, haematocrit 47.5 %, V.C.M 99.4 fl, H.C.M 34.9 pg, C.H.C.M. 35.2 g/dl, R.D.W. (C.V.) 15.9 %, leucocytes 12.07 x10^3 /ul, neutrophils 7.01 x10^3 /μL, neutrophils % 58.1 %, lymphocytes 4.35 x10^3/μL, lymphocytes % 36.0 %, monocytes 0.60 x 10^3/μL, monocytes % 5.0 %, eosinophils 0.08 x10^3/μL, eosinophils % 0.7 %, basophils 0.03 x10^3/μL, basophils % 0.2 %, immature granulocytes 0.04 x10^3/μL, immature granulocytes % 0.30 %, platelets 241 x10^3/μL. V.P.M. 11,6 fl. Coagulation: Prothrombin T. 10,70 sec. Prothrombin T. (%) 101,0 % Prothrombin T. (ratio) 0,99. Partial prothrombin T. 28.50 sec. Derived fibrinogen 447 mg/dl. I.N.R. 0.99.
Emergency ECG: ST-segment elevation of V3-V6 and inferior face.
Chest X-ray: no signs of HF. No pneumothorax line.
Fracture in the 8th right costal arch.
Coronary angiography: anterior descending: stenosis of 75% in proximal third with TIMI 3 flow and good distal bed. Stenosis of 90 % in distal third with TIMI flow
During admission, the patient remains asymptomatic for angina and dyspnoea, with mechanical rib pain related to a fracture of the 8th costal arch.
The patient was discharged home and consultation with Allergology was requested to complete studies. A skin test was performed which was positive, leading to a diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity (immediate, IgE-mediated) to metamizole (NSAID derived from pyrazolone). Furthermore, this mechanism was reaffirmed in vitro, with the induction of basophil activation in response to metamizole stimulation.

DIAGNOSIS
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST-elevation (STEACS) in the context of anaphylactic reaction in a patient with 1-vessel coronary artery disease: Kounis syndrome type II.
Allergy to metamizole (Nolotil).
PTCA + 2 PHARMACOACTIVE STENTS in pAD.
LVEF 45%.
Fracture 8 right costal arch.
