A 64-year-old man consulted the emergency department for three days of clinical symptoms of fever up to 40oC associated with polymyalgia, osteoarthralgia, cervical pain and headache.

History, current illness and physical examination

Reason for consultation: Fever Personal history: Hypertension, nephritic colic, hiatus hernia. On regular treatment with ARA II.

Present illness: 64-year-old man who consulted the emergency department for three days of clinical symptoms of fever up to 40oC associated with polymyalgia, osteoarthralgia, cervical pain and headache.

Physical examination: Conscious, alert and oriented. BP: 79/54 mmHg HR 120 bpm. Poor distal perfusion with coldness in extremities. AC: Tachycardic heart sounds, frequent extrasystoles, no murmurs. AP: Pulmonary sounds without aggregates. Abdomen: soft, depressible, no masses or megaliths. No peritoneal irritation. Osteomuscular: Arthralgias in all limb joints with no evidence of inflammation or embolic phenomena. No meningeal signs. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Complementary tests
- Emergency laboratory tests: leucocytes 9100, neutrophils 88%, platelets 20,000, creatinine 4.8 mg/dL, urea 1.33 g/L, lactic acidosis.
- Urinalysis: Bacteriuria and leucocytes.
- Blood cultures.
- Chest X-ray: Normal.
- Abdominal ultrasound: Normal.
- CT scan of the brain: Normal.


Clinical evolution
During his stay in the Emergency Department, he evolved with a tendency to hypotension and oligoanuria which did not recover with vascular filling; with the initial diagnosis of septic shock, treatment was started with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where inotropic support was started. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed which only showed thickening of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve without clear images of vegetations.
The patient evolved in a torpid manner, hypotension, acute pulmonary oedema requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A few hours after admission, and on suspicion of infective endocarditis, a transesophageal echocardiogram was completed, showing severe mitral insufficiency with a large vegetative image on the posterior leaflet of up to 44 mm in length and 7-9 mm in base on the atrial side, indicating severe mitral insufficiency suggestive of acute evolution.
At this time, blood cultures showed growth of Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to ampicillin and vancomycin.
The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery referral centre. During surgery, a mitral valve with severe endocardial involvement was observed in the mural leaflet that also affected the left ventricular wall, annulus and wall of the right atrium, forming an abscess in the wall and in the atrioventricular groove. The wart and the valve were resected and replaced with a mechanical prosthesis.
The patient evolves in a torpid manner requiring inotropic support, IABP or, without achieving haemodynamic stability. Refractory shock and death three days after IQx.

Diagnosis
- Acute mitral endocarditis due to Staphylococcus aureus
- Mixed shock/multi-organ dysfunction
