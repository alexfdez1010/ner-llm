A 65-year-old patient with a history of liver transplantation and cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV), who came to the emergency department with swelling, oedema and pain in the right lower extremity. Background, current disease and physical examination We present the case of a 65-year-old patient with a history of liver transplantation with cirrhosis due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) the previous year, smoking and no other cardiovascular risk factors who attended the emergency department for swelling, oedema and pain in the right lower limb twin region. A Doppler ultrasound was performed and a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was made. The patient was discharged with anticoagulant treatment (subcutaneous enoxaparin). The patient returned to the emergency department 2 hours after discharge with symptoms of motor aphasia and right hemiparesis suggestive of right middle cerebral artery stroke.

Complementary tests
- Cerebral CAT scan: Normal.
- ECG: Subepicardial lesion of 4-5 mm in inferior face with specular image in high lateral face and decrease of ST in V1-V2 of up to 4 mm compatible with posterior lesion
- Transthoracic echocardiogram: non-dilated LV, preserved LVEF, severe infero-posterior hypokinesia and we observed a redundant interatrial septum with image in right atrium compatible with persistence of Chiari network.
- Urgent catheterisation: Right coronary occluded medially with an image suggestive of an abundant thrombotic component, mechanical thrombectomy was performed with a catheter, extracting several red thrombi with subsequent normalisation of flow (TIMI 3) without finding a residual lesion, so coronary embolism was suspected as the cause of the occlusion of the right coronary, no stent was placed. The left coronary artery was normal.

Clinical Evolution
Once the catheterisation was performed, the patient was transferred to the Coronary Unit where he remained for two days with satisfactory evolution from the cardiological and neurological point of view. Subsequently, given the suspicion of paradoxical embolism (finding of an infero-posterior acute myocardial infarction (AMI) accompanied by a stroke in a patient with a history of recent DVT), a transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated with injection of agitated saline without observing a clear left right shunt. Given the high level of suspicion, we decided to perform a TEE which confirmed the presence of a patent foramen ovale. A CT body scan was also performed to rule out a neoplastic process as the cause of the prothrombotic state, which showed images compatible with hepatic, splenic and renal embolisms. The hypercoagulability study was normal. The patient was discharged on oral anticoagulant treatment and remained asymptomatic to date.

Diagnosis
Multiple embolism (probably paradoxical) in a patient with patent foramen ovale.
