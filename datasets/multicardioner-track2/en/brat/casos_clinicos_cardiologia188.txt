HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
49-year-old woman, under cardiology control since admission in 2015.

BACKGROUND:
Family history: father with infarction at 52 years of age and mother with ischaemic heart disease from 70 years of age. No known allergies. No toxic habits, no arterial hypertension (AHT) or diabetes mellitus (DM). Obesity (in 2015, weight 85 kg and height 165 cm, representing a body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m2). Hypercholesterolaemia diagnosed on admission in 2015: total cholesterol 271 mg/dl, triglycerides 184 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 36 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (calculated) 198 mg/dl. No treatment prior to admission. Cardiological history: admission in June 2015 for acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation (STEMI) of lateral location. Cardiac catheterisation showed single-vessel coronary artery disease, with thrombotic occlusion of the first diagonal, on which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with drug-eluting stent and intermediate stenosis in the middle anterior descending artery (LAD) (FFR > 0.8) (videos 1-3). Echocardiogram showed akinesia in the middle and apical segments of the anterior septum and anterior face, with overall left ventricular (LV) systolic function of 65%. He continued the cardiac rehabilitation programme until November 2015.

CURRENT DISEASE:
Monitored in cardiology consultation since the end of 2016. On treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/day (discontinued ticagrelor one year after acute myocardial infarction [AMI]), bisoprolol 25 mg/day, losartan 50 mg/day (presented cough with ramipril), omeprazole 20 mg/day, atorvastatin 80 mg/day. In the blood test in November 2016, LDL-C levels of 160 mg/dL persisted, well above the target, so ezetimibe 10 mg/day was associated, with a new control after 3 months (the results and therapeutic strategy will be discussed in the section on clinical course). In August 2017, she reported retrosternal discomfort that she described as "burning" unrelated to exertion, although she commented that she had worse tolerance to physical exercise. He acknowledges that he leads a more sedentary life. No significant alterations in the electrocardiogram (ECG) (image 1). The echocardiographic window is not adequate for stress echocardiography and stress single photon emission tomography (SPECT) is requested. At the last review, in December 2017, she was cardiologically asymptomatic. The burning discomfort has disappeared after her primary care physician switched her from omeprazole to esomeprazole. She exercises regularly and has lost 5 kg since August 2017.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Good general condition. Weight 75 kg, height 165 cm. Abdominal waist 95 cm. Blood pressure (BP) 140/67 mmHg. No corneal arc, no tendon xanthomas on inspection. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: ventilation preserved. RsCsRs at 70 beats/min, no murmurs or extratonos. Abdomen soft, depressible, without masses or visceromegaly. Peripheral pulses present, no oedema.  

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
CARDIAC CATHETERISM on admission in 2015: thrombotic occlusion of the first diagonal of great development. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and drug-eluting stent implantation. Intermediate lesion in the middle anterior descending artery (AD) assessed at a second time: FFR 0.96 and 0.89 at distal level. Right coronary artery without significant stenosis.
ANALYTICS in February 2017): blood count without alterations. Glycaemia 92 mg/dl. glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) 5.5%. GFR > 90 ml/min. Normal liver tests. Total cholesterol 226 mg/dl, HDLc 38 mg/dl, triglycerides 170 mg/dl, LDLc 144 mg/dl. ECG August 2017 (image 1): sinus rhythm at 77 bpm, poor R wave progression in right precordial leads with flattened ST (unchanged from previous).
EFFORT SPECT in August 2017 (image 2): exercise stress test according to Bruce protocol. Baseline: heart rate (HR) 68 bpm, BP 122/85 mmHg. Suspended at 6:30 min for reaching targets: HR 155 bpm (90% FHRT) and BP 165/90 mmHg. No angina. Dyspnoea at maximum effort. No ECG changes. Postexercise tomographic images show a severe fixed anteroapical perfusion defect, without reperfusion on rest images. LV systolic function by gated-SPECT 56%, anterior hypokinesia.

CLINICAL COURSE
Young woman at the onset of her coronary artery disease (46 years old, premenopausal) with unknown history of hypercholesterolemia, probably familial. After admission for AMI, optimal medical treatment was prescribed, including high-dose statin and she was referred to a cardiac rehabilitation programme. Subsequent follow-up in consultation detected LDL-C levels well above target (<70 mg/dl), so it was decided to add ezetimibe to the atorvastatin 80 mg she had been taking since admission, before considering treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitors (which had been available for a very short time). After 3 months (February 2017), LDL-C was 144 mg/dL, so evolocumab 140 mg/2 weeks was added to treatment in March 2017. Monthly controls during the following 3 months were: April 2017: total cholesterol 90 mg/dl, HDLc36 mg/dl, LDLc 37 mg/dl. May 2017: total cholesterol 73 mg/dl, HDL-C 42 mg/dl, LDL-C 19 mg/dl. Ezetimibe is withdrawn. June 2017: total cholesterol 99 mg/dl, HDL-C 34 mg/dl, LDL-C 47 mg/dl. And the following LDL-C values: 48 mg/dl (September 2017); 60 mg/dl (December 2017); 65 mg/dl (March 2018). She has had no adverse effects related to lipid-lowering therapy. Blood glucose levels < 100 mg/dl; HbA1c < 5.6%, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 90 ml/min and normal liver tests are maintained. The SPECT scan performed to rule out coronary origin of the chest discomfort showed an area of necrosis without inducible ischaemia. Exercise tolerance improved by resuming regular physical activity and it was concluded that the symptoms were of digestive origin.

DIAGNOSIS
Chronic ischaemic heart disease. AMI in 2015, single-vessel coronary artery disease (first diagonal) with complete revascularisation. Moderate stenosis in the middle LAD. Preserved LV ventricular systolic function. Current functional class I. Hypercholesterolemia difficult to control.
