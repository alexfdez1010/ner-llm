HISTORY, CURRENT DISEASE AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The patient is a 73-year-old male with no allergies, ex-smoker, hypertensive, dyslipidaemic, with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to obstructive uropathy due to benign prostatic hypertrophy: had refused renal transplant, started peritoneal dialysis (PD) in August 2008 with several infectious complications, discontinuing PD in June 2012 due to partial recovery of renal function (creatinine 4"2 mg/dl and GFR 15 ml/min), and again presenting criteria for restarting renal replacement therapy (RRT) since November 2014 (creatinine 7"61 mg/dl and GFR 7"7 ml/min), which he had refused as he was asymptomatic. Hyperparathyroidism and anaemia secondary to CKD. No cardiac history. He reported poor compliance with pharmacological treatment. Admitted to nephrology in November 2016 with end-stage renal failure and anasarca, requiring placement of a right femoral catheter for urgent haemodialysis and transfusion of red blood cell concentrates due to severe anaemia. Examination on admission: BP 224/92 mmHg, HR 90 bpm. Conscious and oriented. Rhythmic heart tones without murmurs, friction rubs or extratones. Jugular ingurgitation and oedema with fovea up to the genital region, with distal pulses not palpable due to oedema. Tachypnoea with bibasal hypophonesis and decreased vocal transmissions of left predominance. Hepatomegaly.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG: sinus rhythm at 90 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, 0o axis, with electrical alternation, without repolarisation alterations. Blood tests: glucose 92 mg/dl, urea 291 mg/dl, creatinine 13.1 mg/dl (FG CKD-EPI 3.3 ml/min/1.73 m2), total Ca 8.69 mg/dl, total proteins 7.17 g/dl, Na 141.3 mmol/l, Cl 114 mmol/l. Venous blood gases: pH 7.15, pCO2 25 mmHg, bicarbonate 8.7 mmol/l, EB -18.6 mmol/l. Haemogram: leucocytes 6.46 x109/l (77.9 % neutrophils, 11.1 % lymphocytes), Hb 4.5 g/dl, HtO 14.9 %, MCV 90.3 fl, MCH 27.4 pg, platelets 148,000 x109/l. INR ratio 1.07. Serology: negative for HCV, HBV and HIV. HBV DNA undetectable. Chest X-ray: cardiomegaly suggestive of pericardial effusion. Lung parenchyma without congestive signs. Left pleural effusion. Echocardiogram: severely hypertrophied LV with good systolic function and diastolic dysfunction due to poor relaxation. LA severely dilated. Normal right chambers. No significant valvulopathies. Severe global pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of haemodynamic involvement: partial collapse of the free wall of the RA, RV and LA, respiratory variation of mitral filling flow of 41%, dilatation of inferior cava (24 mm) and suprahepatic veins without inspiratory collapse of the former and inspiratory inversion of the diastolic component of the suprahepatic vein Doppler. Bilateral pleural effusion. Pleural fluid: exudate. Proteins 3.9 g/dl (5.84 g/dl in serum), LDH 242 U/l (431 U/l in serum with normal values 208-378). Clear appearance. Red cells 300 cells/mm3, leukocytes 391 cells/mm3 (7 % polymorphonuclear, 93 % mononuclear), glucose 94 mg/dl, ADA 9.2 U/l, CRP 10.7 mg/l, pH 7.45. Negative for malignant cells. Negative cultures. Pericardial fluid: exudate. Proteins 4.1 g/dl (6.78 g/dl in serum), LDH 2313 U/l (456 U/l in serum with normal values 208-378). Haemorrhagic appearance. Red cells 945,100 cells/mm3, leukocytes 44,965 cells/mm3 (2 % mononuclear, 98 % polymorphonuclear), glucose 79.7 mg/dl, ADA 16.2 U/l. Negative for malignant cells. Thoracic-abdominal CT: sheet of pericardial effusion. Left pleural effusion with underlying compressive condensation/atelectasis. Bilateral renal atrophy and hydronephrosis and right renal tumours under study. Bilateral renal cortical micronodules, non-specific.

EVOLUTION
Given the suspicion of pericardial effusion on radiological imaging, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, which showed severe pericardial effusion with evidence of haemodynamic compromise but without clinical evidence of tamponade. Initially oriented as probable uremic pericardial effusion, a tunnelled right jugular catheter was placed and haemodialysis was intensified, achieving adequate volume depletion, but without improvement of the pericardial effusion after 12 days. Thoracentesis of the pleural effusion was performed with exudate results, and given the persistence of pericardial effusion despite adequate haemodialysis, it was decided to perform a diagnostic and therapeutic pericardiocentesis. A total drainage of 1400 ml of haematic fluid was obtained, exudate, with abundant leukocytes with a predominance of polymorphonuclear cells, no glucose consumption or increase in proteins, elevated LDH and negative cytology for malignant cells. In view of these findings, it was decided to perform a whole body CT scan to screen for occult neoplasia, and two solid tumour-like masses were observed in the right kidney. With regard to the anaemia, gastrointestinal losses, haemolysis or metabolic deficits were ruled out and attributed to CKD, and treatment with darbepoetin was started.

DIAGNOSIS
Stage V chronic renal failure due to obstructive uropathy. Malignant pericardial effusion. Severe anaemia secondary to chronic renal disease. Renal neoplasia.
