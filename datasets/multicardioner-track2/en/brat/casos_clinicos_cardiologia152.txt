Clinical history and current illness
A 68-year-old man with hypertension, operated in 1990 for aortic valve disease with mechanical prosthesis. Complete AV block in the immediate postoperative period requiring implantation of a transient ventricular epicardial pacemaker and epicardial lead in AD, subsequently a permanent ventricular endocardial lead was implanted. The generator was replaced in 2008 and later the ventricular lead was replaced due to malfunction and a new endocardial system was implanted in July 2009.
Since 2009, the patient reported periodic skin erosions in the implantation area, with serofibrinous exudate during the following two years, and during the last six months he had episodes of shivering with a few tenths of fever, especially at night, which led him to consult his doctor on several occasions. He came to our centre feverish, with a marked worsening in the last two weeks (39.8oC), affected but haemodynamically stable and with suppuration from the decubitus orifice of the pacemaker, for which he was admitted.

Complementary tests
- Physical examination: serofibrinous suppuration through the generator implantation area.
- Laboratory tests: leukocytosis of 26,300 (90% PMN), Hb 11 g/dL, CRP 63, creatinine 0.90 mg/dL, urea 35 mg/dL.
- Chest X-ray: 3 electrodes are visualised, two of them normoinserted attached to the implanted generator, normoinserted and a dissected epicardial lead lodged in the right atrium. Condensation images are also seen in the right hemithorax.
- Blood cultures: two batches taken 30 minutes apart from each other from two different sites and on different days with and without fever, with growth of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis.
- Culture of decubitus exudate: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis.
- Transthoracic echocardiography: a vegetation of about 20 mm is visualised in the right atrial cable. Other echocardiographic parameters were normal. No prosthetic dysfunction. Mild tricuspid regurgitation.


Clinical evolution
After admission, the infection was treated comprehensively with parenteral bactericidal antibiotherapy directed at the germ isolated in the cultures and the removal of the entire system and a new implant on the right side once the patient remained afebrile and blood cultures were repeatedly negative, after two weeks of antibiotic treatment.

Diagnosis
Endocarditis due to infection of the pacemaker generator and leads without valvular involvement.
