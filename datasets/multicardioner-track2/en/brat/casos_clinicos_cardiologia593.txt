Genetic study: after study of genes related to dilated cardiomyopathy, a variant of uncertain significance c.5009G>A; p.(Arg1670His), in probable heterozygosis, has been observed in the LAMA4 gene. Variants in this gene have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, a pathology with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Echocardiogram at one year follow-up (video 3): Severely dilated and dysfunctional left ventricle, due to very marked general hypokinesia and slight asynchrony; Dd 71 mm (2D), x Simpson calculations: VTD 246 ml, VTS 163 ml, EF 34%. Biphasic left ventricular filling with E/A of 2.5, average E/e' 9.5. Dilated left atrium (34 ml/m2). Normal aortic root. Coil catheter in right chambers, right ventricle (RV) non-functioning with TAPSE of 19 mm and S' at 12 cm/s. Very mild TR allowing estimation of PSAP at 35 mmHg + PVC. Suprahepatic vessels not dilated. No pericardial effusion. Conclusion: DCM with biventricular dysfunction. Severe LV dysfunction with asynchrony unchanged with respect to previous ultrasound.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
During his evolution, the patient showed improvement in dyspnoea and oedematisation of the lower limbs, maintaining a good diuresis rate after adjustment of treatment. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was requested, showing dilated cardiomyopathy with severe biventricular dysfunction, non-compaction on the lateral side and late anteroseptal subendocardial enhancement, which ruled out myocarditis as the cause. However, in view of the finding of subendocardial late enhancement, angio-CT of the coronary arteries was requested to rule out ischaemic origin of the dysfunction in view of the possibility of a congenital coronary anomaly, but the study was normal. Finally, a genetic study was requested to determine the aetiology, which was positive for DCM with variant of uncertain significance c.5009G>A; p.(Arg1670His) in probable heterozygosis in the LAMA4 gene. During follow-up, the patient showed good evolution without clinical signs of heart failure, but because the ejection fraction did not improve despite medical treatment, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted for primary prevention together with resynchronisation therapy (CRT) due to the presence of a wide QRS of 140 msec and asynchrony. The ICD was implanted without incident, but a resynchronisation lead could not be implanted due to the impossibility of cannulating the coronary sinus. The case was presented to the Heart Team to determine the best therapeutic option for failed CRT implantation, and the decision was made to implant a pacemaker with Hisian pacing. The procedure was performed 6 months after diagnosis, in which the His zone was located with selective capture, but without QRS shortening, so the left branch was located, obtaining a narrower QRS (144 msec) but with R morphology in V1. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic from the cardiac point of view, although with persistent left ventricular dysfunction and asynchrony in the echocardiographic control one year after diagnosis and after implantation of the pacemaker with physiological stimulation in the His bundle. Therefore, this is a clinical case of a patient with diagnosed tuberous sclerosis associated with dilated cardiomyopathy whose aetiology has not been identified since the genetic study shows an inconclusive mutation. The association between both entities is rare.
