HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
46-year-old woman diagnosed by chance with hepatic angiomas, with no other medical or surgical history of interest. She consulted the cardiology department for self-limited episodes of rapid and regular palpitations, with abrupt onset and end, with no other accompanying symptoms. Physical examination revealed elevated jugular venous pressure up to the mandibular angle, with no oedema in the lower limbs. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs. No other data of interest.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Laboratory tests: blood count and biochemistry normal. Normal thyroid hormones. Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, narrow QRS, normal repolarisation. Chest X-ray: increased cardiothoracic index. Normal lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiogram: left ventricle of normal size and function. Normal left atrium. Right atrium occupied by a large intracavitary mass. Morphologically normal valves, without dysfunction. Moderate pericardial effusion with dilated inferior vena cava. After administration of a sulphur hexafluoride ecopotentiator, no uptake by the mass was observed. Transesophageal echocardiogram: large intracavitary mass at the level of the right atrium, occupying and filling practically the entire cavity, without reaching the tricuspid valve plane or the atrioventricular groove, with a broad base of implantation at the level of the atrial roof and the interatrial septum, well defined, measuring 8 cm x 6 cm, with very heterogeneous echographic characteristics inside, with large anechoic areas and other dense areas, with an irregular interior appearance. This mass crosses the fossa ovalis towards the left atrium, resting superiorly against the aorta without infiltrating it. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): large mass in the RA (9 x 7 cm), well-defined borders, does not appear to infiltrate the wall or pericardium, relatively homogeneous, appearing isointense on T1 sequences, while on T2-weighted sequences it appears hyperintense. After gadolinium administration, there is an absence of perfusion in the first step and only very slight heterogeneous enhancement in the late phases. Cranio-thorax-abdomen CT scan: well-defined 84 x 99 mm lesion occupying practically the entire right atrium, contacting the uppermost part of the atrium and the interatrial septum, with minimal introduction through the interatrial septum into the left atrium. It contacts the anterior zone of the right pulmonary artery and the right ascending aorta. Persistently hypodense with IV contrast. Large hepatomegaly with areas of uptake, in relation to his known angiomatosis. CT scan of coronary arteries: coronary arteries without lesions.

Pathological anatomy of the tumour: intramyocardial cavernous cavernous haemangioma with papillary endothelial hyperplasia. No signs of malignancy were observed in the material studied. Inguinal adenopathies reactive lymphadenitis.

EVOLUTION
Following the clinical manifestations described and the findings on examination, a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested with the results described. After finding evidence of a large tumour in the right atrium, various imaging tests were performed. Without a definitive diagnosis, and with the differential diagnosis of myxoma versus sarcoma, the patient underwent surgery. Resection of the tumour in the right atrium was performed with intraoperative biopsy. The right atrium and interatrial septum were reconstructed with two patches of bovine pericardium. Surgical findings: atrial tumour with a spongy appearance, highly vascularised, with a wide base of implantation in the roof of both atria and the interatrial septum. Small atrial septal defect with respected fossa ovalis. Infiltration only of the interatrial septum, with absence of epicardial infiltration of other structures. An intraoperative biopsy was performed, which showed a tumour formed by inter-anastomosed vascular channels, without cytological atypia with lymphoid aggregates. Vascular tumour of low malignant potential. Postoperative evolution was uneventful, remaining haemodynamically stable and cardiovascular asymptomatic. In subsequent follow-ups, the patient presented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the rhythm being controlled with flecainide. She remained stable, with no evidence of recurrence in subsequent echocardiograms.

DIAGNOSIS
Intramyocardial cavernous haemangioma with papillary endothelial hyperplasia.
