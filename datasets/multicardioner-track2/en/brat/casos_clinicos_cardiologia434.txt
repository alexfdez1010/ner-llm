HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

BACKGROUND:
60-year-old male, no known drug allergies, as cardiovascular risk factors he is a smoker of 15 cigarettes/day, hypertensive and dyslipidaemic. Other antecedents include an anxious-depressive syndrome, chronic bronchitis with bronchodilator treatment and he is an ex-miner. He underwent surgery for a right hip fracture 5 years ago and a right ankle fracture more than 20 years ago. No personal or family history of heart disease or sudden death.
He follows regular treatment with fluoxetine 40 mg/24 hours, omeprazole 20 mg/24 hours, bromazepam 1.5 mg/24 hours, valsartan 160 mg/24 hours, pravastatin 20 mg/24 hours, formoterol 100/beclomethasone 6 mcg 1 inhalation/24 hours, and salbutamol on demand.

CURRENT ILLNESS:
On the day prior to admission, the patient reported starting with a catarrhal condition, with general malaise and no fever, for which reason he went to his primary care physician on the day of admission, who prescribed antibiotic treatment with moxifloxacin 400 mg. After taking the first dose, he began with intense itching of the scalp, followed by sweating, skin rash, oppressive non-radiating central thoracic pain and intense dyspnoea. They called emergency services and on arrival of 112 they found the patient dyspnoeic, with significant respiratory distress, hypotensive (blood pressure [BP] 80/60) and with an oxygen saturation of 78%, which improved after administration of serum therapy and bronchodilators, so he was transferred to our centre. On arrival at our centre, the patient was admitted to the emergency department and found to be haemodynamically stable and not in respiratory distress, with improvement in oxygenation parameters, and cardiology was contacted and he was admitted to the coronary unit of our centre.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure 130/70. Heart rate 85 bpm. Temperature 36 Â°C. Conscious, oriented, good distal perfusion. Eupneic on room air without supplementary oxygen. Chest emphysematous. Head and neck: no IVY, no hepatojugular reflux. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: Global hypoventilation. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation. Extremities: no oedema, no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) (112): sinus rhythm at 95 bpm, PR 160 MS, narrow QRS. Axis 60o. Inferior ST supra-segment elevation.
ECG (coronary unit): SR at 100 bpm, PR 160ms, narrow QRS. q III. ST segment normalisation.
THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: normal cardiothoracic index with no evidence of vascular redistribution.
ANALYSIS (in the coronary unit):
CBC: leukocytes: 18.8 10e3/ul (80.2% neutrophils, 16.7% lymphocytes); haemoglobin 17.5 g/dl; platelets 331 10e3/u.
Biochemistry: creatinine 1.02 mg/dl (GFR 72ml/min/m2); urea 42 mg/dl, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.1 mEq/l, blood glucose 119 mg/dl. Peak CK 232 U/l (normal range 10-192); peak CKMB 35 U/l; peak ultrasensitive troponin 195 ng/l (normal range 0-13).
Total cholesterol 187; LDL 106; HDL 38; triglycerides 212. AST 23 U/l (normal range 15-41); ALT 15 U/l (normal range 0-13). Thyroid hormones within normal range.
Coagulation: INR 1.02; prothrombin rate 89%.
Arterial blood gas (FiO2 21%): pH 7.30, PCO2 37, PO2 76, bicarbonate 18, saturation 90%.
CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary arteries without angiographically significant lesions.
ECOCARDIOGRAM: left ventricle not dilated, with slight hypertrophy, with preserved global function without segmental abnormalities of contractility (LVEF calculated at 60%). Right ventricle of normal size and function. Left atrium slightly dilated. No valvular heart disease. Inferior vena cava not dilated with adequate inspiratory collapse. No pericardial effusion. Normal aortic arch.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
On arrival at the coronary unit, the patient was asymptomatic, with no new episodes of angina, and haemodynamically stable, with normalisation of the repolarisation alterations that he presented at the beginning of the picture. A haemodynamic study was performed, showing coronary arteries without lesions and an echocardiogram showing a ventricle of preserved size and function with no contractility abnormalities. During admission, he presented acute renal failure, with metabolic acidosis that resolved with treatment, and a referral was made to the allergology department. After performing skin tests, the symptoms were interpreted as allergic vasospastic angina or KS secondary to moxifloxacin. Subsequently, during his stay in the cardiology ward, he remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view and it was decided to discharge him on the fifth day and continue outpatient controls.

DIAGNOSIS
Allergic vasospastic angina (SK).
Allergy to quinolones.
