49-year-old woman, who, while teaching, presented with dizziness and general malaise, followed by loss of consciousness.

History, current illness and physical examination
Personal history: No known allergies. Smoker of 1 pack a day. No alcohol or other drugs. High blood pressure, discontinued pharmacological treatment. Mild dyslipidaemia on dietary treatment. Anxiety-depressive syndrome. Episodes of anxiety for 8 years, consisting of chest pains, palpitations, sweating and paleness. She was assessed by Cardiology for these episodes, with no significant findings. She was subsequently assessed by psychiatry a year ago. Paroxetine was prescribed, and the episodes, which were very frequent (almost daily), disappeared. However, in the week prior to the cardiac arrest that led to her admission, she had again presented pictures of central thoracic pain, with significant vegative crusade without syncope or palpitations, lasting a few minutes and spontaneous recovery.
No family history of heart disease.
Usual treatment: paroxetine.
Current episode: 49-year-old female patient who, while teaching (she is a secondary school teacher), presented with dizziness and general malaise, followed by loss of consciousness. According to her co-worker, they initially felt for a pulse, noting a very high heart rate, and then stopped feeling a pulse. The school staff started basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres for about 20 minutes, which was the time it took for the SAMU to arrive. On arrival, the SAMU monitored the patient and found ventricular fibrillation on the monitor and administered a 200 J shock, leaving the patient in a rhythm that appeared to be atrial fibrillation (no clear atrial mechanism, narrow QRS, HR 99-100 bpm). She was intubated after sedation-relaxation with 30 mg midazolam and 10 mg norcuronium. The patient was transferred to the hospital and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

Physical examination:
Blood pressure: 112/62 mmHg, HR: 92 beats/min. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no murmurs or friction rubs. Pulmonary auscultation (intubated): No extra sounds. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no masses or megaliths palpable. Lower limbs: No oedema. Peripheral pulses preserved and symmetrical.

Complementary tests
- ECG: Sinus rhythm at 90 bpm. Axis at 0o. NO alterations in atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction. Adequate progression of R in precordial leads. No repolarisation alterations.
- Echocardiogram: Left ventricle of preserved size and function, without segmental alterations of contractility and with pseudonormal filling pattern (E>A that reverses with Valsalva). Absence of significant valvulopathies. RV of preserved size and function. Minimal tricuspid insufficiency that allowed estimating a PsAP of 35 mmHg. NO signs of increased central venous pressure.
- Chest X-ray: Bibasal interstitial pattern. Right hilum thickening.
- Cranial CT: No haematic collections or space-occupying lesions in cerebellar parenchyma or brainstem. Ventricular system and sulci without alterations. Midline structures centred.
- Laboratory tests: Biochemistry: Glucose 289 mg/dl, creatinine 0.69 mg/dl, CRP 3.1 mg/L, Na 140 mEq/l, K 4.9 mEq/l, CK 246 to 495 U/l, ultrasensitive troponin T: 130 to 1509 ng/l. Haemogram Hb 14.6 g/dl, haematocrit 44.8%, leucocytes 10,600, neutrophils 55.5%, platelets 307,000.
- Haemostasis: INR 1.
- Urine toxicity: Positive for benzodiazepines.

Clinical course
After a cranial CT scan, the patient was connected to invasive mechanical ventilation and a right subclavian central line was placed. Initially the patient had mydriatic pupils, but reactive to light, under the effects of sedorelaxation administered by the SAMU. Sedoanalgesia was started with propofol and remifentanil, and hypothermia for 24 hours. Echocardiography ruled out segmental contractility alterations and showed a normal right ventricle. The ECG showed no signs of acute ischaemia, no signs of pre-excitation, no QT lengthening, and no changes suggestive of Brugada. Cranial CT ruled out brain lesions justifying the cardiac arrest. Blood tests showed no electrolyte abnormalities. Amiodarone infusion was started, but had to be suspended 24 hours after the start of administration due to the ECG showing QT prolongation. The day after his admission (with normal QT corrected) he presented episodes of Torsades de pointes, which led to ventricular fibrillation, for which reason lidocaine perfusion was started for 48 hours. The ECG prior to the ventricular arrhythmia showed signs suggestive of infero-posterior and lateral subepicardial lesions (ST segment elevation >4mm II, III, aVF, V5 and V6 with mirror image V1-V2). Coronary angiography showed non-significant lesions in the anterior descending artery, very spastic, improving with intracoronary nitroglycerine; 70% stenosis in the middle segment of the right posterolateral branch, with good distal flow. The study was completed with cardiac MRI which ruled out cardiomyopathy.
Given the suspicion of sustained vasospasm causing myocardial ischaemia and ventricular arrhythmias, calcium antagonists were prescribed; and due to the coronary lesions, antiplatelet therapy was started (initially clopidogrel and adiro), which after an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (self-limited melena) was maintained only with clopidogrel. Since then, no new ventricular arrhythmias were recorded on continuous ECG monitoring. The patient remained haemodynamically stable throughout the admission, being extubated and with progressive improvement of her neurological situation, being completely oriented, without any residual focality and presenting only a certain degree of anterograde amnesia, with difficulty in retaining the events following the cardiac arrest. Despite the absence of new arrhythmic episodes after vasodilator treatment, prior to discharge it was decided to implant a bicameral ICD, which took place without incident. She was reviewed in the outpatient clinic 3 months after discharge without any new episodes of chest pain or syncope. No sustained ventricular arrhythmias were recorded during device monitoring.

Diagnosis
- Coronary vasospasm
- Ventricular fibrillation and resuscitated cardiac arrest
