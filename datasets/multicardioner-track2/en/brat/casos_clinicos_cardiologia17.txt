A 58-year-old man was admitted to the Cayetano Heredia Hospital with a 2-month history of vomiting, fever of 38°C and severe disabling back pain. Clinical examination revealed a multifocal holosystolic murmur, predominantly in the mitral focus of intensity III/VI, radiating to the axilla and neck. Positive Lasegue and Psoas sign, as well as positive Dandy sign at L3, L4 and L5.

Laboratory data obtained on admission were: haemoglobin: 12.2 g/dl, haematocrit: 38%, white blood cell count: 14.01/μl (neutrophils: 64.5%), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): 116 mm/h and C-reactive protein (CRP): 1/16 mg/l. Chest X-ray showed no signs of condensation.
Similarly, the electrocardiographic tracing at rest showed no relevant alterations.

Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mitral and aortic valve involvement characterised by vegetations on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (atrial and ventricular surface of segment A2) and a 1.6 x 1.3 cm perforated aneurysm (0.7 cm) with severe regurgitation. Also, in the aortic valve, multiple vegetations were found in the three leaflets; the largest measuring 0.9 cm, with severe regurgitation and flow compatible with perforation of the posterior semilunar leaflet.

Streptococcus gordonnii was isolated in blood cultures. Additionally the lumbosacral MRI showed vertebral osteomyelitis of L4-L5.

During the surgical procedure, the aforementioned findings were confirmed and the aortic and mitral bivalvular replacement was performed with the implantation of mechanical prostheses.
