70-year-old man with acute myocardial infarction complicated by fever and pericardial effusion.

History, current illness and physical examination
No known drug allergies. Former smoker until 20 years ago (cumulative consumption 64 packs/year). Dyslipidaemia treated with diet. No systemic hypertension, no DM. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome diagnosed in 1994 after an episode of pulmonary thromboembolism. Chronic venous insufficiency with recurrent vascular-venous ulcers in right lower limb. Surgical interventions: cholecystectomy and right inguinal hernioplasty. Usual treatment: Acenocoumarol, Pentoxifylline and escin. The patient was a 70-year-old male with the aforementioned personal history who, while at rest, presented with severe retrosternal chest pain with oppressive characteristics, radiating to the left upper limb and accompanied by intense vegetative cramping. The emergency department performed an electrocardiogram showing sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in DI, AVL, V2-V3 and ST-segment depression in DII, DIII and AVF. He was given 300 mg of ASA and 600 mg of clopidrogrel plus nitroglycerine and intravenous morphine chloride. He arrived at the Haemodynamics Unit, 4,000 IU of intravenous sodium heparin was administered and primary PTCA was performed on the culprit lesion of the anterior descending artery at the level of the proximal segment two hours after the onset of symptoms.
He was subsequently admitted to the ICU where he remained for 48 hours, remaining haemodynamically stable with no arrhythmic events or signs of heart failure. Subsequently admitted to the Cardiology ward, the physical examination on admission showed the patient to be asymptomatic with an adequate level of consciousness, oriented and cooperative, BP 110/70 mmhg, HR 70 bpm. He was afebrile, eupneic, tolerated decubitus, on cardiopulmonary auscultation rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs or pericardial friction, vesicular murmur present bilaterally with minimal crackles in the lung bases, soft abdomen, not distended, hydroaerial sounds present, no peripheral oedema, no neurological deficit.
From the seventh day of admission, she presented with chest pain that increased with deep inspiration and changes in posture without new variations in the ECG, accompanied by palpitations, with paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (120-140 bpm) associated with daily febrile peaks (38-40 Â°C) without infectious symptoms at respiratory, urinary and abdominal levels. Samples were taken for serial blood and urine cultures, which were repeatedly negative. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a non-dilated LV with akinesia in anteroseptal and apical segments, LVEF 35% and circumferential pericardial effusion with moderate fibrin (15 mm) producing partial collapse of the RV in end-diastole with respiratory variations in tricuspid and transmitral Doppler velocity. From the analytical point of view, there was discrete leukocytosis, neutrophilia, ESR and elevated CRP.  

Complementary tests
- ECG: Sinus rhythm at 88 bpm. IAH. PR 200 ms. ST elevation of 2-3 mm in DI and AVL, 3-4 mm in V2-V3 with sharp T wave and specular decrease in the inferior leads
- CBC: haemoglobin 15.2 g/dl, MCV 85 fl, leukocytes 11,400, neutrophils 82%, lymphocytes 12%, eosinophils 0.5%, platelets 160,000. Biochemistry: Creatinine 0.60 mg/dl, urea 34 mg/dl, sodium 140 meq/l, potassium 4.8 meq/l, glucose 114 mg/dl, CRP 89.7 mg/l. Myocardial damage markers: ultrasensitive Troponin T (peak 10,000 ng/l), CPK (peak 5,938 mU/ml)
- Blood cultures (x3): No microbiological isolation.
- Urine culture: No microbiological isolation.
- Portable chest X-ray: Cardiomegaly, congestive pattern, no pneumonic condensation.
- Initial transthoracic echocardiography: circumferential pericardial effusion, with fibrin, with a width of 16 mm in the lateral wall of the LV, 14 mm in the apex, 15 mm in the RA and 15 mm in the diaphragmatic face of the RV. There is partial collapse of the RV in end-diastole in expiration and >25% reduction of the mitral E wave in inspiration and >50% reduction of the tricuspid E wave in expiration. Dilated inferior vena cava (29 mm), with little inspiratory reduction. LA not dilated. Normal mitral valve. Normal aortic valve. Non-dilated LV (EDV: 83 ml), without hypertrophy. Inferolateral wall normokinesia, apical and septal akinesia and hypokinesia of the rest. EF 35%. Normal right ventricle. Tricuspid valve without insufficiency.
- Cardiac catheterisation: TCI without significant angiographic lesions. ADA: Atheromatous vessel. Thrombotic obstruction at proximal segment level, with TIMI 0 initial flow. Non-dominant ACx: Atheromatous and calcified vessel. Significant disease at the distal segment of the main marginal: Bifurcated lesion with distal beds of small calibre, non-diseased. Chronic occlusion of the middle segment. Distal beds of good calibre and development, not diseased, visualised through the right coronary artery. Dominant RCA: vessel of good calibre and development, with parietal irregularities, without significant angiographic lesions. Primary PTCA on the culprit lesion of the proximal LAD thromboaspiration and direct implantation of conventional stent. Good initial angiographic result, with final TIMI 3 flow. Good distal vessel, not diseased.

Clinical evolution
Given these findings, the differential diagnosis of the origin of the fever was considered; firstly in the context of Dressler's syndrome and less likely an infectious aetiology; treatment was started with 500 mg of ASA every 6 hours, 0.5 mg of colchicine every 24 hours and in conjunction with the Infectious Diseases Unit it was decided to start empirical antibiotic therapy with 400 mg of teicoplanin every 12 hours until the results of the blood cultures extracted were obtained. The initial evolution was favourable with disappearance of fever during the next 48 hours, with evident improvement in the patient's general condition and due to the absence of microbiological isolation in the blood cultures, antibiotic therapy was suspended after 72 hours. However, in the following days the patient's general condition worsened again with recurrence of fever and the control echocardiography showed an increase in the amount of pericardial effusion (36 mm at lateral level of the RV, 18 mm at apical level of the LV and 37 mm at subcostal level); for this reason it was decided to start oral corticosteroids at a dose of 60 mg of prednisone every 24 hours. In the following days the clinical evolution was favourable with disappearance of fever, progressive improvement of general condition and gradual decrease of inflammatory markers, echocardiography at 2 weeks showed a significant decrease in the amount of pericardial fluid. Finally, the patient was discharged home, asymptomatic and in acceptable functional class with a tapering corticosteroid regimen

Diagnosis
- STEMI anterior Killip I, underwent primary PCI and conventional stent implantation (x2) in the proximal segment of the LAD. Severely depressed LVEF.
- Coronary artery disease in mid-segment of ACx and distal segment of non-revascularised main marginal.
- Post-MI pericarditis and circumferential pericardial effusion in the context of Dressler's syndrome. - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
