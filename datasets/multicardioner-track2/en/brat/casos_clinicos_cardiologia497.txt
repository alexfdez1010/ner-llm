HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Patient aged 22 years, with no known pharmacological allergies and no medical or surgical history. No family history of heart disease or history of sudden death in the family. Habitual sportsman. No toxic habits.

Current illness
The patient came to the hospital to have his teeth extracted by means of a scheduled operation in the maxillofacial operating theatre for outpatient surgery.
He had been previously assessed by anaesthesia preoperatively, with normal physical examination, blood tests without alterations and ASA I evaluation.
No baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed due to his age, in accordance with hospital protocol. During this procedure, the patient presented with a heart rate of around 45-50 beats per minute, and given that this was interpreted as bradycardia, prior to anaesthetic induction, 0.5 mg of atropine was administered as an intravenous bolus. The patient then presented with symptoms of precordial pressure, palpitations and profuse diaphoresis, and the monitor recorded a rhythmic tachycardia with wide QRS at 150-160 beats per minute, compatible with sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting one minute, with spontaneous transition to sinus rhythm. A bolus of 200 mg amiodarone was administered without further episodes.

Physical examination
Blood pressure 110/50 mmHg. Heart rate 75 bpm. O2 saturation 100% (FiO2 0.21). Conscious, oriented, normal colour, normohydrated, good distal perfusion. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart sounds without murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: normal vesicular murmur. Abdomen was nondescript. Extremities without oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG (operating room): sinus rhythm at 80 bpm. PR 0.180 msec. Narrow QRS. ST-segment depression in V3-V5 and in III and avF with negative T waves in these same leads. ECG (Emergency): sinus rhythm at 74 bpm, variable PR (between 0.08-0.10) and occasionally retroconducted P wave, some nodal beats.
Blood tests: troponin I 0.22 mg/ml. Myoglobin 66. Serialisation: troponin I 2.56. Myoglobin 22. Haemogram without alterations (Hb 15.8 g/dl). Renal function and ions normal. Hepatic profile without alterations. Cholesterol 182 mg/dl.
Transthoracic echocardiogram: LV of normal size and wall thickness, with hypertrophy of both papillary muscles. Global LV systolic function normal, without segmental asymmetries of contractility. Diastolic pattern: normal.
Left atrium of normal dimensions. Right chambers of normal dimensions; RV normocontractile. Aortic root and visualized portion of proximal ascending aorta of normal dimensions. MV: thin leaflets, not limited in its opening, competent. VAo: trivalve, normal sigmoids, not limited in its opening, competent. IT minimal. IVC not dilated with normal inspiratory collapse.
Estimated normal PAPs. Absence of pericardial effusion and intracavitary masses through this access route.
Cardiac MRI: left ventricle at the high limit of normality (DTD: 56 mm), with normal systolic function. No hypertrophy or focal areas of late enhancement indicating fibrosis. Mild RV dilatation with normal EF. Non-dilated atria. Minimal MI. Mild TR.
Coronary angioCT: coronary arteries with normal anatomical origin. No lesions in epicardial coronary arteries.

EVOLUTION
After the episode of self-limited ventricular tachycardia, a 12-lead ECG was performed showing repolarisation alterations suggestive of myocardial ischaemia on the anteroseptal side with subsequent normalisation, although showing competition between sinus rhythm and nodal rhythm.
Since the patient had presented with clinical signs of precordial tightness together with the ECG findings described, it was initially treated as an acute coronary syndrome and enzyme serology was performed with peak troponin I of 2.56 ng/dl. Beta-blockers (bisoprolol) were started at low doses. Subsequently, the patient remained asymptomatic with no new episodes of angina, arrhythmias or electrical changes in the electrocardiogram. Given the patient's clinical manifestations compatible with ventricular arrhythmia secondary to a probable acute coronary event, it was decided to admit the patient for further study.
Echocardiography and cardiac MRI were requested to rule out underlying cardiomyopathy, as well as coronary angioCT to rule out coronary artery disease.
These tests ruled out structural heart disease. The case was discussed with the arrhythmia unit, which performed an electrophysiological study that was negative for induction of ventricular arrhythmias or reentrant arrhythmias and no evidence of accessory pathways.
After ruling out structural heart disease and induction of arrhythmias in the electrophysiological study, it was concluded that the ventricular tachycardia presented was secondary to a probable coronary ischaemic event (the patient presented chest tightness with associated vegetative symptoms, clear alterations in the ECG and increased markers of myocardial damage). The ECG alterations described and the elevation of markers of myocardial damage would not be secondary to the ventricular tachycardia as it was of very short duration. Therefore, we believe that the ventricular tachycardia was the secondary event to myocardial ischaemia. Given that the angioCT findings ruled out any structural abnormality that could cause ischaemia, the presence of coronary vasospasm triggered by a sudden change in heart rate in the context of intravenous administration of atropine was proposed as the first diagnostic probability.
Since the patient had no cardiovascular risk factors and no clinical history of angina, it was not considered necessary to perform coronary vasospasm provocation studies. Medical treatment with calcium antagonists was not initiated as a clear trigger for the episode was identified. The beta-blockers that had been started were withdrawn as they have been described as a possible trigger for coronary vasospasm. With the results of the complementary tests and the good prognosis of the same, and with a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia in the context of probable coronary vasospasm secondary to the administration of intravenous atropine, hospital discharge was decided for outpatient monitoring without initiating any pharmacological treatment for the time being.

DIAGNOSIS
Ventricular tachycardia secondary to vasospasm due to atropine.
