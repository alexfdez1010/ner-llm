A 63-year-old woman presented with a clinical picture of three months' evolution consisting of feverish peaks with shivering, intense asthenia, hyporexia and a weight loss of 7 kg. She had previously required dental manipulation (osseo-integrated implants).

History, current illness and physical examination
No medical history of interest, no cardiovascular risk factors, no toxic habits or surgical history, no known drug allergies. Blood tests performed by the primary care physician showed normocytic anaemia and persistent leucocyturia and haematuria in urine, so treatment was started with ferrous salts and two 10-day cycles of treatment with ciprofloxacin 400 mg/12h, one month apart, achieving improvement in general condition and disappearance of fever, which reappeared 7 days after the end of the last cycle of treatment. He suddenly presented with motor aphasia, left facial paralysis and loss of strength in the left upper limb; the neurological symptoms were fluctuating and recurrent, with residual weakness persisting in the left upper limb, and after visiting the emergency department he was admitted to the Neurology Department for examination.
Physical examination on admission: BP 110/60 mmHg, HR 90 bpm, O2 sat 98% baseline. Conscious, oriented, reactive, perceptive. No palpable lymphadenopathies. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic heart tones at 85 bpm, pansystolic murmur of intensity III/VI at mitral focus, radiating to the axilla. Pulmonary auscultation: preserved vesicular murmur. Abdomen: soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, no masses or megaliths palpable. Lower extremities: no oedema or signs of deep vein thrombosis.
Neurological examination in the emergency department revealed: very mild motor aphasia, left central facial paralysis and paresis of the left upper limb with strength 4/5.

- Serology of serum/plasma: No findings for lupus, hepatitis B and C, HIV, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, Borrelia burgdorferi.
- Microbiology. Blood cultures: Gram-positive coccobacilli in chains (in 2 of 2 samples sent initially) with final isolation of Abiotrophia defectiva, of intermediate sensitivity to penicillin (MIC 0.25), sensitive to the rest of antibiotics tested. Urine culture: Negative.
- Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography: Left ventricle not dilated, hyperdynamic, LVEF 80%. Left atrium not dilated. Mitral valve: Prolapse of the P1 festoon of the posterior leaflet. Image of 8x6 mm in the cusp of festoon A1 of the anterior leaflet, with anarchic movement, echolucent areas inside, suggestive of endocardial vegetation. Severe mitral insufficiency towards the septum and anterior wall that reverses the flow in pulmonary veins. Restrictive filling pattern with elevated end-diastolic pressure data. Normal aortic valve and flow. Aortic root of normal size. Normal right chambers, no IT detected that would allow estimation of PAP. No pericardial effusion.

Clinical evolution
Given the echocardiographic findings of endocarditis on the mitral valve (with prolapse of the P1 festoon of the posterior leaflet and vegetation on the cusp of the A1 festoon of the anterior leaflet) with severe mitral insufficiency with haemodynamic repercussions, and data suggestive of acute severe valvular regurgitation (absence of dilatation of left chambers) with a picture of probable peripheral embolism at cerebral level (with normal neurological tests), it was decided to transfer him to the Coronary Unit for initial evolutionary control: During five days in the unit, the patient remained haemodynamically stable, without requiring vasoactive drugs, remaining normotensive and in sinus rhythm at 90-100 bpm. Renal function was preserved, with good diuretic response at low doses and no clinical or radiological signs of heart failure. From the neurological point of view: Glasgow 15, persistence of central left facial paresis and with improvement of strength and sensitivity of the left upper extremity until normalisation. She was subsequently transferred to the cardiology ward for follow-up.
From the beginning, the patient was followed up by the Infectious Diseases Unit: Initially, given the clinical suspicion of endocarditis of three months' evolution and the findings in blood cultures of gram-positive coccobacilli in chains (suspected streptococcus), empirical antibiotherapy was started with ceftriaxone (2 g iv/24 hours) associated with gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day iv/24 hours) and vancomycin (30 mg/kg/day iv in 2 doses/24h), achieving rapid disappearance of fever. Once the germ was identified in blood cultures as abiotrophia defectiva, after 10 days of empirical treatment, it was decided to modify antiobiotherapy to ampicillin (2g/4h) + ceftriaxone (2 g/12h), which had to be suspended after an urticarial reaction secondary to its administration. The new antibiotic regimen consisted of vancomycin + gentamicin, with negative fever and blood cultures, and a total of six weeks of antibiotic therapy was recommended. After two weeks of antibiotic treatment, a new transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, with findings similar to the initial one: persistence of severe mitral insufficiency, prolapse of the P1 festoon and an image suggestive of endocarditis over the A1 festoon. Four weeks after the start of antibiotic therapy, scheduled surgery was performed to replace the mitral valve with a St Jude No 29 mechanical prosthesis, without preservation of the posterior subvalvular apparatus.
The entire procedure was uneventful. Good postoperative evolution in the ICU and on the Cardiac Surgery ward without arrhythmias, with early withdrawal of inotropes and mechanical ventilation, normal renal function and absence of fever. In agreement with the Infectious Diseases Unit, it was decided to discontinue antibiotic treatment 6 weeks after its initiation, after confirming negative microbiology in the heart valve sample, with control blood cultures after 48 hours (which were negative) and subsequent follow-up in the Outpatient Department. Prior to discharge, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing normal mitral prosthetic function and no images suggestive of endocarditis. Asymptomatic and stable, she was discharged from hospital. She was followed up in outpatient clinics without incident.

Diagnosis
- Infective endocarditis on native mitral valve (with valvular prolapse of the p1 leaflet of the posterior leaflet and endocardial vegetation in the a1 leaflet of the anterior leaflet) with severe mitral insufficiency with haemodynamic repercussions.
- Cerebrovascular accident of probable embolic origin.
