HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
85-year-old woman referred for chest pain.

BACKGROUND:
Intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
No toxic habits.
Hypertension. No diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia.
Cardiology evaluation in 2013 for palpitations with normal Holter and mild concentric hypertrophy in the echocardiogram.
Other history: polymyalgia rheumatica, lumbar spondylosis, macular degeneration, anxious-depressive syndrome, chronic venous insufficiency.
Surgical interventions: total right hip replacement (2011) after fracture and uterine myomectomy.
Current treatment: bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 24 hours, valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide 80/12.5 mg every 24 hours, esomeprazole 20 mg every 24 hours and venlafaxine 150 mg every 24 hours.
Baseline situation: lives alone. Independent for basic activities of daily living.


CURRENT ILLNESS:
85-year-old woman who came to our centre brought by the emergency services for an episode of oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the jaw and shoulders, with onset at rest and accompanied by vegetative cortex. During transfer to the emergency department, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered with improvement, and the patient was subsequently asymptomatic. The clinic was present for approximately 45 minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure (BP) 131/72 mmHg. Heart rate (HR) 74 bpm. Baseline O2 saturation (SatO2) 100%. Afebrile. Conscious, oriented and cooperative. Eupneic at rest. Good general condition, normohydrated and normal colour. Rhythmic carotids without murmurs, no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation (CA): rhythmic without audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation (PA): with preserved vesicular murmur without over-additions. Abdomen soft, depressible, not painful on palpation, without masses or megaliths. Lower limbs without oedema or signs of phlebitis. Radial, femoral and anterior tibial pulses preserved and symmetrical.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ANALYSIS: haemoglobin 11.9 g/dl, platelets 268,000/mm3, leukocytes 6,790/mm3 (with normal formula). Coagulation normal. Glucose 91 mg/dl, urea 56 mg/dl, creatinine 1.09 mg/dl, CKDEPI 46 ml/min, sodium 140 mEq/l, potassium 4.9 mEq/l, triglycerides 121 mg/dl, total cholesterol 184 mg/dl (HDL 42 mg/dl, LDL 118 mg/dl), uric acid 7,0 mg/dl, ALT 42 IU/l, AST 262 IU/l, GGT 22 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase 98 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dl, iron 42 ug/dl, transferrin 2.12 mg/dl, IST 15.6%, ferritin 52.3 ng/ml, TSH 1.33 ng/dl, HbA1c 5.8%. Troponin I 0.87 ng/ml on admission, peak 126 ng/ml (high limit of normal 0.08 ng/ml).
AP THORAX RADIOGRAPHY: slight elongation of the aorta, right costophrenic sinus impingement, fluid in the right major fissure. Cardiovascular silhouette poorly assessable by technique.
ECG (admission): sinus rhythm at 70 bpm with normal PR and narrow QRS, ST segment rectification on the lateral side.
ECG (coronary unit): sinus rhythm at 75 bpm, normal PR, subepicardial lesion wave with lateral negative T.
ECOCARDIOGRAM: regular echocardiographic window. LV of normal size and global systolic function, with hypokinesia of the posterior face. Dilated left atrium with area 28.3 cm2.
Right chambers of normal size. Calcification of the mitral annulus. No significant insufficiency detected. Normal tricuspid with moderate insufficiency. RV-AD systolic gradient 34 mmHg.
Normal inferior vena cava. Normal aortic with mild-trivial insufficiency, without pathological gradient.
CARDIAC CATHETERISM: coronary arteries without lesions except for a filling defect in the first obtuse marginal. Aspiration of whitish material was performed with two fragments of 1 cm each, which were sent to pathological anatomy for study. After extraction, the artery was left with TIMI 3 flow.
PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY: calcified, acellular material with atheroembolic morphology.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
With the diagnosis of NSTEACS, the patient was admitted to the coronary unit and remained asymptomatic from the cardiovascular point of view throughout her admission. Early catheterisation showed coronary occlusion of embolic aetiology, without being able to establish the source of atheroembolism, so given that she did not present a high risk of haemorrhage, anticoagulation was started empirically. Blood pressure and heart rate were controlled during admission, with no arrhythmias observed. The patient was discharged three days after admission.

DIAGNOSIS
Ischaemic heart disease. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) non-Q, Killip I.
Repletion defect in obtuse marginal artery of embolic aetiology. Coronary arteries without lesions.
Preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.
