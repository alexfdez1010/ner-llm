40-year-old patient, referred from Nephrology after an echocardiogram showed severe concentric LVH, suggestive of myocardial infiltration, EF in the lower limits of normality.

History, current disease and physical examination
History: 40-year-old patient, no known drug allergies. Personal history of pulmonary TB in 2004, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, diagnosed at 19 years of age, uses hearing aid, familial hypomagnesaemia, short stature (familial short stature), chronic renal insufficiency of unknown aetiology, being transplanted in 2002, evolved with acute tubular necrosis, left eye venous thrombosis, systemic arterial hypertension, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, diabetic gastroparesis.
Surgical interventions: Cholecystectomy. Renal transplant.
Current treatment: Treatment with prednisone, advagraf, mycophenolate, losartan 100 mg/12 hours, insulin, magnesium, acfol, erythromycin and ranitidine.
Current illness: Referred from Nephrology, after finding severe concentric LVH on echocardiography, suggestive of myocardial infiltration, EF below normal limits.
Physical examination: Good general condition. Normohydrated and normoperfundio. No signs of heart failure. Venous and central pressures normal. Palpation nondescript. Rhythmic tones, no murmurs. Normal ventilation. No hepatomegaly or oedema. Peripheral pulses preserved. BP 115/85. Complementary tests MRI without I.V. contrast of the heart (11/04/2012).
Regions studied - COR- : Heart. Findings / diagnostic indications impression Clinical report: Sd Allport. Renal transplanted. DM. De novo HF. Pattern suggestive of restrictive cardiomyopathy by echocardiographic infiltration.

Gradient echo sequences were performed in 4-chamber planes, short axis, T2-weighted spin echo sequences and triple IR in short axis, basal perfusion and late enhancement with gadolinium. Informed consent form was given, which the patient read and signed. The study was limited due to the patient's lack of cooperation because of severe hypoacusis. Left ventricle volume within normal limits (68.5 ml/m2), increased myocardial mass (114 gr/m2). Concentric hypertrophy (middle septum 16 mm, inferolateral wall 15 mm). Ejection fraction at lower limit of normal. Right ventricle of normal volumes, wall hypertrophy. Ejection fraction within normal. Atria volumes within normal. Aortic, mitral and pulmonary valves without significant alterations. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Absence of pericardial effusion. Normal pericardial thickness. After gadolinium administration, diffuse late enhancement, at basal inferior subepicardial level, subepicardial in lower middle third and inferolateral. Intramyocardial at medial lateral and apicolateral level, pattern suggestive of Fabry disease as first option Severe gastric dilatation with contents inside, in a probable context of gastroparesis in a diabetic patient.
In summary: Infiltrative cardiomyopathy suggestive of Fabry disease. Gastric gastroparesis. Right ventricle. Sinus end-diastolic volume VD 47.6 ml. Sinus end-systolic volume RV 17.2 ml. Total TVD VD 47.6 ml. Total RV ESV 17.2 ml. RV beat volume 30.3 ml. Sinus EF RV 63.8 ml. RV ejection fraction 63.8%. RV end-diastolic volume index 34.5 ml/m2. RV tele-systolic volume index 12.5 ml/m2. Left ventricle. Anteroseptal Parietal Thickness 14.6 mm. LV Posterior Parietal Thickness. 14.7 mm. Tele-diastolic diameter 43.8 mm. LV end-systolic diameter 31.2 mm. LV end-diastolic volume 82 ml. LV end-systolic volume 42.5 ml. Epicardial end-diastolic volume 227.1 ml. LV ejection fraction 48.2%. LV end-diastolic volume index 59.5 ml/m2. LV end-systolic volume index 30.8 ml/m2. Fractional shortening 28%. Beat volume index 28.7 ml/m2. Heart rate 52 bpm. Cardiac output 2.1 l/min. Cardiac index 1.5 l/min/m2. LV TD mass 152.3g. Biochemical and genetic analysis: Alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity: 876 nmol/h per mg-protein. Genetic analysis: Mutation in the alpha-gal-A gene, in exon 5, c680a-- -t, amino acid change, genotype R227Q.

Clinical course
The patient is stable from the cardiovascular point of view, with no chest pain, no signs of heart failure, no dyspnoeic or syncopal symptoms.

Diagnosis
Restrictive infiltrative cardiomyopathy in a patient with symmetric concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, mutation of the alpha-galacotsidase A gene and enzyme deficiency associated with Fabry-Anderson disease.
