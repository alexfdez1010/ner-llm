Clinical history and current disease
53-year-old patient with a history of dyspnoea on exertion of 6-12 months of evolution, poor window in previous echocardiogram. She came for a new echocardiogram after losing weight due to diet. No chest pain or syncope. HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. Metrorrhagia with uterine curettage in 2004. She was assessed in the Internal Medicine outpatient department in 2004 for severe anaemia secondary to the above, and a colonoscopy was also performed for rectorrhagia with the finding of internal haemorrhoids. Chronic HBsAg carrier followed up in Preventive Medicine. Admitted in 2009 for pneumonia. Previous medication: ibuprofen 600 mg, spironolactone 25/hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg, metoprolol 50 mg, ramipril 5 mg.

Additional tests
- CBC: white blood cells 6,820, red blood cells 4.49, haemoglobin 13.4, haematocrit 38.8, mean corpuscular volume 86.4, mean corpuscular haemoglobin 29.7, platelets 227000, INR 1.01, fibrinogen 360, glucose 94, urea 47, creatinine 0.92, sodium 142, potassium 4.8, estimated glomerular filtration rate >60, glomerular filtration rate EPI 71.
- Electrocardiogram: sinus rhythm at 53 bpm with no other alterations of interest. No changes suggestive of ischaemia, cavity enlargement (perhaps LA enlargement) or conduction disturbances.
- Chest X-ray: mild cardiomegaly with no radiological signs of heart failure.
- Echocardiogram: LV not dilated or hypertrophic. Preserved systolic function. Mild aortic insufficiency with no gradient across it. Large mass (58x42 mm) in the left atrium with no visible pedicle or Doppler flow inside it, which protrudes minimally into the left ventricle, causing mild mitral insufficiency and moderate mitral obstruction flow. Mild TR with estimated PSP of 60-65.

Clinical evolution
In view of the echocardiogram findings, the patient was transferred to the referral hospital where the evaluation was completed with coronary angiography showing coronary arteries with right dominance and no significant angiographic lesions and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showing a mass in the left atrium (62x46x40 mm) with a pedicle originating in the interatrial septum, the signal was intermediate in T1-weighted sequences, hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences and with central enhancement in the late phases of the dynamic study with gadolinium compatible with myxoma that prolapses through the mitral annulus during diastole. It was decided to perform elective surgery by transseptal access, myxoma implant was found in the septum-ceptum of the left atrium and complete resection of myxoma was performed, closing the septum with an autologous pericardium patch. During the postoperative period, an episode of atrial flutter with variable conduction and good ventricular response that did not reverse despite treatment with amiodarone. At the time of discharge the patient presented atrial flutter at 60 bpm, continuing treatment with v.o. amiodarone until the review date.

Diagnosis
- Arterial hypertension
- Obesity
- Mass in the left atrium, probably myxoma
