A 46-year-old woman attended the emergency department for central thoracic pain described as oppressive, sometimes radiating to the throat and on other occasions to the left arm and forearm.  History, current illness and physical examination Personal history: Female, 46 years old. No allergies. She denies DM, AHT, dyslipidaemia or hypertriglyceridaemia. Ex-smoker for 10 years, 20 packs/year. Hypothyroidism in substitutive treatment. Depressive syndrome under pharmacological treatment. Surgical interventions: Caesarean section.
No personal history of heart disease.
Family history: Three paternal uncles died of ischaemic heart disease at the age of 70. Living father does not recognise cardiovascular pathology. Living mother with DM. 1 apparently healthy brother. No family history of syncope or sudden death.
Usual medication: Eutirox 75 mcg/day, thymanax (agomelatine).

Reason for consultation: She came to the emergency department for central thoracic pain described as oppressive, sometimes radiating to the throat and on other occasions to the left arm and forearm. There was no vegetative cortex, dyspnoea or palpitations. The pain does not change with changes in posture, inspiration or palpation. First episode of these characteristics 3 days ago, at rest, unrelated to ingestion. The pain appears and disappears progressively, although its duration is usually short (a few minutes) and is repeated several times over a couple of hours. They usually occur during the night. Not related to exertion. No sensation of palpitations (neither with the pain nor outside these episodes). No clinical signs of heart failure. No febrile or infectious symptoms. She has never presented syncopal episodes. She only refers to a history of short palpitations for which she has never had to consult a doctor and generally in states of increased nervousness (she denies having had them these days). She does not take regular physical exercise.

Physical examination: Vital signs: BP: 163/71 mmHg; HR 60 bpm; O2 Sat: 100%. Conscious and oriented in time, space and person. Carotid pulses of symmetrical amplitude, non-sustained. No murmurs. No jugular ingurgitation. AC: rhythmic, first and second sounds preserved. No murmurs or friction rubs. AP: preserved vesicular murmur.
No pain on palpation of the left costal arches. Abdomen soft, depressible, diffusely painful on palpation, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. No masses, hernias or visceromegaly were palpable. Hydro-aerial sounds present. No oedema of the lower limbs. Palpable and symmetrical distal pulses.

Clinical evolution
During his stay in the bedridden area, he again presented a new episode of chest pain which coincided with the presence of multiple ventricular extrasystoles on cardiac monitoring.
It was decided to discuss this with Cardiology due to the suspicion of haemodynamic angina. The monitor showed episodes of sinus bradycardia around 46 bpm, ventricular bigeminy and several episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, with a change in the electrical axis with respect to the baseline ECG and with various morphologies. In one of the tracings the tachycardia is monomorphic, although not fully rhythmic. In another tracing it shows two morphologies (due to the change of the electrical axis between the complexes, it appears to be a bidirectional tachycardia). The estimated heart rate during the tachycardias (we do not have a 12-lead ECG at any time) is around 140-180 bpm. After admission to cardiology, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no new arrhythmic events on monitoring. Given the clinical presentation of chest pain at rest, with ventricular tachycardia on monitoring, in a patient without enzyme elevation and with a normal baseline ECG, it was decided to screen for the different causes that could be related to the appearance of the arrhythmia.
Psychiatry was consulted for a joint review of the side effects of agomelatine, a melatoninergic agonist (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and a serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist. There were no data linking this drug to arrhythmic events or prolongation of the QT interval, despite which it was decided to withdraw it. An echocardiogram was performed, which showed no structural heart disease. As a test for anatomical assessment of the coronary arteries, a CT scan of the coronary arteries showed significant stenosis in the middle portion of the anterior descending artery. This finding led to coronary angiography which confirmed the lesion, which was treated by direct conventional stent implantation. Good clinical evolution during admission, with no new episodes of chest pain or ventricular extrasystoles on the monitor. Regular blood tests showed dyslipidaemia.
She was discharged with statin, double antiplatelet therapy, ACE inhibitors and hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism. The tendency to low heart rate did not allow the introduction of beta-blockers. She was assessed in outpatient consultations 4 months after discharge, with a holter without alterations and asymptomatic.

Diagnosis
- Unstable angina
- Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
- Significant lesion in the middle anterior descending artery
