HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Reason for consultation: chest pain and syncope.

Personal history
37-year-old woman with adverse drug reaction to enantyum and paracetamol (skin rash). Ex-smoker for 4 years (AOD: 25 p/a).
Surgical interventions: cervical disc herniation operated on in private clinic at the end of 2012, appendectomy.
Family history: father AMI at 38 years of age, subsequent reinfarction, mother AMI at 57 years of age.

Cardiological history: according to the private clinic report provided: October 2010: onset of chest pain and cardiac catheterisation in which there was no evidence of coronary lesions. Patient was asymptomatic after the episode until January 2013, a few months after the cervical hernia operations.
Cardiac catheterisation was performed in February 2013: LMCA without lesions, proximal LAD lesion 52%, Cx and CD without lesions. MIBI was performed and small septal ischaemia was reported, so a Biomatrix 11 mm drug-eluting stent was implanted in the LAD. After stent placement, symptoms persisted and catheterisation was repeated in April 2013, with no evidence of new lesions or intra-stent restenosis. LV size and contractility normal
Since April, symptoms worsened with fatigue and progressively disabling chest pain on minimal exertion, with lack of response to multiple treatments, at some point sinus tachycardia at 130 bpm and transient LBBB were observed. There is a suspicion of microvascular angina and painful LBBB.
EPS was performed with no arrhythmic inducibility and later CMR showed mild ischaemia at the septoapical level.
Baseline: since 1 month ago dyspnoea on minimal exertion, unable to lead an active life. Previously active in sporting activities, although he reported long-standing chest discomfort related to exercise without warm-up.
Usual treatment: ASA 100 mg 0-1-0, sumial 20 mg 1-1/2-1/2, simvastatin 10 mg 0-0-1.

Present illness
A 37-year-old female patient came to the emergency department with syncope in the context of chest pain. On climbing stairs she presented with oppressive central thoracic pain radiating to the jaw and left hemithorax together with dyspnoea with subsequent loss of consciousness lasting seconds. The pain lasted for a total of 5 minutes, subsiding on sitting and at rest. No sphincter relaxation, no tonic-clonic movements and no post-syncopal confusion.
For the last month the patient has been experiencing daily chest pain on increasingly less exertion, in the last few days on minimal exertion.

Physical examination
Afebrile, HR 55 bpm, BP 119/56 mmHg, Sat(aa) 98%. C and O in all three spheres, quiet cooperative. BEG; NC and NH. Eupneic. ACV: RCR, no murmurs or extratonos, no IY. Palpable and symmetrical pedial pulses, palpable and symmetrical femoral pulses.
AR: VCM without superimposed sounds. ABD: soft and depressible, no megaliths, no signs of peritoneal irritation. No murmurs, preserved peristalsis.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
ECG: Rs at 60 bpm, normal PR, narrow QRS, isolated negative T in V1.
Chest X-ray: CTI within normal limits, Mediastinum not widened, SCF free, no condensation in lung parenchyma.
CBC 05/05: leukocytes 6,180 ^3/uL (76 %), Hb 12.6 g/dl, Hto 35.8 %, platelets 213.00 10^3/uL, INR 0.99, D-dimer 149 ng/ml, glucose 88 mg/dl, urea 27 mg/dl, creatinine 0.69 mg/dl, Na 141 mEq/l, K 3.8 mEq/l.
Biomarker curve: negative. Admission blood test (06/06): Quick: 81 %, INR: 1.16. Glucose 91 mg/dl, U 22 mg/dl, Cr 0.67 mg/dl, urate 5 mg/dl, TG 65 mg/dl, CT 162 mg/dl (HDL 54, LDL 95), total bili 0.7 mg/dl, GOT/GPT 16/14 u/l, GGT/FAL 15/63 u/l, total prot 63.5 g/l, albumin 38.7 g/l, Na+ 141 mEq/l, K+ 3.8 mEq/l, Cl 108 mmol/l, HbA1c: 4.9 %.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (June 2014): overall normal systolic function. Normal sized left ventricle. Normal LV global systolic function. EF 59%. No abnormalities of segmental contraction or longitudinal strain involvement. Diastolic function not assessable due to associated lesions. No LV hypertrophy. Left atrium of normal size. Right ventricle of normal size.
Left catheterisation (June 2014): stent in the proximal descending anterior descending artery permeable without hyperplasia or restenosis. Rest of artery without lesions.
Circumflex artery and right coronary artery without significant lesions. The ergonovine test was performed. She started at maximum dose with precordial pain without angiographic alterations but electrocardiographically she presented complete AVB with escape rhythm that responded spontaneously to sinus rhythm.
Ergometry 09/06/14: Bruce 03:05, maximum HR 171 bpm, maximum BP 150/90, maximum load: 4.8 METS. Normal resting ECG, very limited functional capacity. Conclusions: stress test terminated by fatigue and chest pain, at the end of the first stage without electrical changes. Abnormal tachycardia with standing, at the start of the test HR 130 bpm. Hormones: TSH 0.43 Î¼UI/mL, FT4 1.04 ng/dl, NT-ProBNP 41 pg/mL.
Autoimmunity study: LDH 178 u/l, CK 63 U/l, aldolase 3.7 U/l, CRP 0.36 mg/dl, ANA negative, RF < 20 IU/mL, haemolytic capacity CD 78 U/mL.
Metanephrines in 24-hour urine: 24-hour acid diuresis, 80 ml. Metanephrine, normetanephrine, methoxytyramine pending.
Right heart catheterisation June 2014: right heart catheterisation via the right jugular vein without immediate complications. PVC 5 mmHg, VD 26/0 mmHg, PAPs 18-19 mmHg, PAPd 4-5 mmHg, PAPm 10 mmHg, PCP 5 mmHg, GTP 5 mmHg, GC 6.2 L/min, IC 3.5 L/min/m2. Systemic vascular resistances 1100 dyncm5. Pulmonary vascular resistance less than 1 Wood Unit. Conclusions: pulmonary pressures, cardiac output, PCP, PVC, systemic resistances and pulmonary resistances within normality. There is no RV-PA gradient, ruling out pulmonary stenosis.
PFR (June 2014): normal, SatO2 unchanged on standing upright. Slight alteration of the MEF.
TLM: events: RS with intermittent LBBB at any rate , bouts of sinus tachycardia often detected at 130-140 bpm with standing and from 150 bpm with LBBB conduction.
Standing test: with reproducible standing, a disproportionate tachycardia (> 30 bpm of baseline HR, > 150 bpm, sinus tachycardia with or without LBBB) without hypotension, which reproduces his symptoms of weakness, malaise, nausea, pallor, chest discomfort, distal cyanosis with intense asthenia even exacerbated by speech, these symptoms disappear along with the sinus tachycardia rapidly with decubitus.

EVOLUTION
The patient is a 37 year old female smoker with a history of moderate disease of a stented vessel in the LAD, the defect observed at rest after the drug is not very suggestive of ischaemia and is more related to her LBBB.
No structural heart disease, ventricular function, filling pressures and normal cardiac output. Patent stent.
His clinical manifestations and the standing test were diagnostic of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, with very advanced and disabling symptoms.
Three lines of pharmacological treatment and progressive desensitisation through exercise were started.

Thus, treatment at discharge consists of:
Postural measures, frequent drinking of water, diet with salt.
Acetylsalicylic acid: 100 mg, 1 tablet, oral, Co.
Fludrocortisone: 0.1 mg, 1 tablet, Oral, De.
Methyldopa: 125 mg, 0.5 tab, oral, Ce.
Propranolol: 10 mg, 1 tablet, oral, DeCe.
Simvastatin: 10 mg, 1 tablet, Oral, Ce

DIAGNOSIS
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
Intermittent/frequency dependent left bundle branch block (LBBB).
