Current illness
Patient admitted to the internal medicine department (MIN) for progressive worsening of functional class to the point of presenting minimal effort dyspnoea (NYHA III), associated with orthopnoea, paroxysmal dyspnoea and intense asthenia.

Absence of alterations in segmental contractility at rest. Absence of significant valvulopathies. Right ventricle with preserved contractility. Trivial tricuspid insufficiency (TI) with PAPs 45 mmHg. Dilated inferior vena cava 24 mm without inspiratory collapse. Severe pericardial effusion of global distribution with significant haemodynamic compromise of the right cavities.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
On evaluation by the cardiologist on duty, the patient was in obstructive shock secondary to cardiac tamponade as seen by transthoracic echocardiography. It was decided to cautiously administer intravascular volume, to associate treatment with norepinephrine and to immediately transfer him to the coronary care unit.
Once in the coronary care unit, it was decided to check the patient's haemogram and haemostasis in order to perform diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis, with unacceptable figures for this procedure without haemorrhagic risk.
Given the persistence of obstructive shock in the context of cardiac tamponade despite the prescribed intravenous treatment, it was decided to request and administer 2 ampoules of idarucizumab as an antidote for the patient's anticoagulation. The improvement of haemostatic parameters was verified in control analyses, which allowed the procedure to be carried out one hour after administration.
Diagnostic/therapeutic pericardiocentesis guided by echocardiography was performed and 650 cc of serohematic fluid was extracted with evident haemodynamic improvement. Samples of pericardial fluid were sent for study.
In the following days the patient showed a favourable evolution with haemodynamic stability without vasoactive/inothropic support and negative balances and progressive improvement of clinical and radiological signs of congestion.
A control echocardiogram was performed showing minimal residual pericardial effusion with no evidence of haemodynamic compromise, so the drain was removed without complications after 24 hours, dabigatran was reintroduced and medical discharge was decided.

DIAGNOSIS
Obstructive shock in the context of cardiac tamponade.
Severe pericardial effusion complicated by cardiac tamponade.
Reversal of dabigatran anticoagulation with idarucizumab for emergent pericardiocentesis.
Pericardiocentesis with drainage of 560 cc serohematic cc.
Permanent atrial fibrillation anticoagulated with dabigatran.
Polyserositis under study.
Constitutional syndrome under study, probably Erdheim-Chester syndrome (polyostotic sclerosing histiocytosis).
