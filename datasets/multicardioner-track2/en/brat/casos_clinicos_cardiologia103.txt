A 62-year-old woman was brought in by the UTE for two episodes of epigastralgia, cold sweats and dizziness without loss of consciousness, while sitting down after dinner, while playing Parcheesi.

History, current illness and physical examination

History: No CVRF. No cardiological history. Diverticulitis: Medical treatment until 3 days ago. No history of syncope. No other history of interest. No usual treatment.

Current illness: On arrival at the Emergency Transfer Unit, while a venous line was being cannulated, she had a new episode of dizziness with no ECG recording. During the transfer, while in decubitus position, with no apparent trigger, she had another episode of dizziness with similar characteristics and the monitor showed an asystole of 25 seconds, without loss of consciousness according to the patient and the ambulance doctor. She arrived at the Emergency Department, the Coronary Unit was notified and it was decided to admit her and implant a temporary pacemaker, which was left deactivated.

Clinical evolution
During the night there were no new episodes of asystole, presyncope or syncope. The following morning, while the introducer was being cleaned, the nurse said to the patient, "look, here is the introducer", at which point the patient said "oh, don't tell me that", she lost consciousness and the monitor showed asystole of 15 seconds, and the pacemaker was manually activated at that moment. After questioning the patient, she reported that she had always felt dizzy when pricked with a needle.
It was decided to implant a permanent pacemaker in the patient, she was discharged to the ward, and the following day when she went for a control chest X-ray in a wheelchair, the patient presented a new episode of intense dizziness, and it was found that the pacemaker electrode was correctly positioned and no failures were detected in the ECG with magnet. She was discharged.
