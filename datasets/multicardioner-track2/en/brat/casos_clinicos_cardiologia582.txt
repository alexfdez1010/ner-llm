HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

History
80-year-old woman. No known adverse drug reactions. Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension with good ambulatory control. Non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus with good outpatient control. Mixed dyslipidaemia with good outpatient control. Denies toxic habits. Cardiological history: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with two electrical cardioversions (2016 and 2018). Other medical and surgical history: depressive disorder, essential thrombocythemia, severe neurotrophic corneal ulcer operated on. Usual treatment: fluoxetine 20 mg (1 tablet every day, started one month ago), lorazepam 1 mg (every day), acenocoumarol 1 mg (1 tablet every day and adjust according to controls), amiodarone 200 mg (1 tablet every other day), chlorthalidone 50 mg (1 tablet every day), irbesartan 300 mg (1 tablet every day), felodipine 5 mg (1 tablet every day), atorvastatin 20 mg (1 tablet every day), glimepiride 20 mg (1 tablet daily), linagliptin 5 mg (1 tablet daily), doxycycline 200 mg (1 capsule daily) and 1 tablet 100 mg (daily), moxifloxacin ophthalmic, paracetamol/tramadol 75/650 mg (1 tablet every 12 hours), famotidine 20 mg (1 tablet daily), pantoprazole 20 mg (1 tablet daily), anagrelide 0.5 mg (2 tablets every 7 days).   Present illness The patient is an 80-year-old woman who comes to the point of continuous care (PAC) for symptoms of loss of consciousness the day before the consultation and on three occasions during the same, lasting approximately 30 seconds and complete spontaneous recovery. She also had a feeling of dizziness of the unsteadiness type and previous tinnitus, with no associated vegetative cortex. No palpitations. No semiology of heart failure. No chest pain. No infectious clinical manifestations due to equipment. During her stay in the PAC, she presented a new episode witnessed by the doctor, who defibrillated on evidence of pulseless ventricular fibrillation (PSVF) on the electrocardiogram - which we do not have - and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) manoeuvres for less than 5 minutes. After recovery of sinus rhythm, the patient was referred to the hospital emergency department. Once there, the critical box monitor showed a torsade de Pointes (TdP) rhythm, initiated by the phenomenon of R over T, self-limited for seconds, with presyncopal symptoms, so isoproterenol and magnesium sulphate perfusion was started. It was decided not to implant a temporary pacemaker due to the non-relapse of the arrhythmia with isoproterenol perfusion (the patient remained in sinus rhythm at 95 bpm) and was admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for monitoring and correction of triggering factors. Physical examination Blood pressure (BP) 125/84 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 95 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% with FiO2 21%. Digital blood glucose 238 mg/dl. Good general condition. Conscious and oriented. No signs of respiratory distress. Cardiopulmonary auscultation: regular, no audible murmurs. Vesicular murmur preserved, without added noises. Abdomen: soft and depressible, no palpable masses or organomegaly, not painful on palpation. No signs of peritoneal irritation. Lower limbs: no oedema. No signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Neurological: conscious and oriented. Glasgow 15. Mild bradypsychia. Language correct in form and content. Cranial nerves without alterations. Normal eye movements. Pupils isochoric, normoreactive. Strength and sensitivity of limbs preserved and symmetrical (5/5).

Increased bilateral perihilar alveolar raster, which could correspond to discrete oedema. There were no images suggestive of pulmonary consolidation. Free costophrenic sinuses. Cardiomegaly. Calcification of the aortic button. Degenerative changes in the dorsal spine. Coronary angiography: epicardial coronary arteries without lesions.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
During her stay in the OCU, the patient remained asymptomatic and electrocardiograms showed prolonged QT interval (QTc 639 ms), of probable iatrogenic acquired aetiology, as she was taking up to 3 drugs with known risk of TdP (moxifloxacin, anagrelide, amiodarone) and 4 that could be arrhythmogenic in specific conditions (fluoxetine, pantoprazole, famotidine and tramadol). In addition, blood tests showed mild hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia, electrolyte disorders that predispose to prolongation of the QT interval. For all these reasons, it was decided to discontinue the predisposing medication and to supplement magnesium, calcium and potassium to correct their plasma levels. After 48 hours of monitoring without new episodes and correction of the QTc to 540 ms, it was decided to transfer him to the cardiology ward to complete treatment and study (HF with severe ventricular dysfunction with moderate mitral insufficiency (MI) on regular echocardiography). During her stay in the cardiology ward, coronary angiography was performed to complete the study of dilated cardiomyopathy without any pathological findings. The patient progressed favourably and due to clinical and haemodynamic stability and correction of the electrocardiographic alteration, after 19 days in hospital it was decided to discharge her home with subsequent monitoring and follow-up by the heart failure unit. Pharmacological treatment was started for HF with reduced LVEF (sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg [1 tablet every 12 h], eplerenone 25 mg [1 tablet every 24 h], nebivolol 2.5 mg [0.5 tablet every 24 h], dapagliflozin 10 mg [1 tablet every 24 h], furosemide 40 mg [1 tablet every 24 h]) together with magnesium 53 mg [2 tablets every 12 h] and edoxaban 30 mg [1 tablet every 24 h]. Similarly, it was decided to discontinue drugs precipitating QT interval prolongation (fluoxetine, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, pantoprazole and famotidine). In the cardiology outpatient follow-up, one month after discharge home, and after optimal medical treatment of HF, the patient showed clinical stability with no recurrence of HF, partial recovery of LVEF (current LVEF 40%) and QT interval within normal limits. Therefore, the patient is labelled as non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with a tachycardiomyopathy component and treatment is maintained at the appropriate doses.

DIAGNOSIS
Iatrogenic acquired prolonged QT interval (pharmacological and hydroelectrolytic) with arrhythmic events in the form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de Pointes) and recovered cardiorespiratory arrest.
Heart failure with reduced LVEF in the context of non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with some component of tachycardiomyopathy.
Coronary arteries without lesions.
