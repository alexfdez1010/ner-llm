HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

PERSONAL HISTORY
50-year-old male. Allergy to streptomycin.
No family history of ischaemic heart disease.
Toxic habits: smoker 1.5-2 packs a day for 30 years until 1 week before the event. Alcohol consumption: not until the event. Other intoxicants: cannabis use in youth, not for years.
Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF): hypertension (HT) under treatment. Mixed dyslipidaemia.
Cardiological history: admission to cardiology from 8/7 to 19/7 for acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation (STEMI). A first catheterisation was performed (8/7/2017) which revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with acute obstruction of the cuneiform artery (Cx). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with two stents coated in CX with good results. The right coronary artery (RCA) and anterior descending (AD) had significant lesions amenable to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in the second stage. Another catheterisation was performed at a second time (18/7/2017) with scheduled PCI with implantation of two coated stents in the DA, DX and another two in the CD with a good final angiographic result. The echocardiogram performed during admission (8/7/17) reports: non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with LVEF 45-50%. Inferolateral hypokinesia. Normal right ventricle (RV). No valvulopathies. Rest normal. From the clinical point of view, no complications during admission. Double antiplatelet therapy was started with ticagrelor, which was later changed to prasugrel (due to possible interaction with antiretrovirals). Good tolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) and beta-blocker at medium doses.
Other personal history:
HIV infection, currently on treatment with undetectable viral load. With proteinuria, hepatic haemangiomas and hypovitaminosis D.
No other relevant medical-surgical history.
Baseline functional status:
Diet: average adherence to Mediterranean diet.
Physical activity: before the event, moderate activity during working hours, not in leisure time.
Psychosocial profile: he was a baker and deliveryman, he closed his company 2 years ago. He now takes care of his mother. He has two children aged 13 and 15.
Previous treatment: adiro 100 mg (every 24 hours), prasugrel 10 mg (every 24 hours), bisoprolol 2.5 mg every 12 hours, enalapril 5 mg (every 12 hours), atorvastatin/ezetimibe 80/10 mg (every 24 hours), fortnightly calcifediol. Antiretroviral treatment: abacavir/lamivudine + nevirapine.
Pre-programme status: referred from cardiology outpatient clinic for cardiac rehabilitation programme. Cardiovascular asymptomatic after discharge.

CLINICAL COURSE
EVOLUTION IN THE CARDIAC REHABILITATION UNIT
The patient is included as moderate risk in the programme, attending training sessions 3 days a week for 2 months. He underwent aerobic and strength training, monitored with telemetry for 6 weeks and then with a heart rate monitor for the last 2 weeks, tolerating exercise well. Coronary asymptomatic at all times, no arrhythmias, no episodes of pain. BÃ¶rg 14-16.
In February 2018 he starts with self-limited but recurrent episodes of rectorrhagia with slight anaemisation. After 7 months of the event, it is decided to change prasugrel for clopidogrel, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding.
On the other hand, she continued with mixed dyslipidaemia with elevated non-HDL and moderate hypertriglyceridaemia despite treatment with atorvastatin and ezetimibe 80/10 mg. Treatment with fenofibrate 145 mg every 24 hours was started.
In the control echocardiogram, left ventricular systolic function remained slightly depressed.

SITUATION AT DISCHARGE
In March 2018, the cardiac rehabilitation programme was completed and new ergospirometry was performed, in which a low peak VO2 persisted for his reference population in the context of peripheral exercise limitation; however, the intermediate cardiovascular parameters were acceptable.
With regard to the control of cardiovascular risk factors, adherence to the Mediterranean diet improved and the abdominal circumference decreased by 5 cm. In the control analysis, there was a clear improvement in the lipid profile but it was still outside the target ranges in two determinations performed by ultracentrifugation of the sample. She therefore met the criteria for initiation and funding of treatment with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (iPCSK9) inhibitors, and the case was presented to our centre's committee and accepted. In September 2018, he attended the cardiac rehabilitation unit for the administration of the first dose of evolocumab and education. In October 2018, he underwent his first check-up after starting treatment with iPCSK9, with a lipid profile in range.
Last control analysis (10/10/18) with ultracentrifugation: triglyceride 98 mg/dl, cholesterol 96 mg/dl, apolipoprotein A1 181 mg/dl, apolipoprotein B 31 mg/dl, lipoprotein (a) 58 mg/dl, lipid ultracentrifugation: VLDL-cholesterol 12 mg/dl, VLDL-triglyceride 83 mg/dl, LDLcholesterol 31 mg/dl, LDL-triglyceride 91 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 65 mg/dl, HDL-triglyceride 7 mg/dl, VLDL cholesterol/triglyceride 0.07, chylomicrons negative.
Next check-up in 6 months.
