76-year-old woman reviewed for bronchial asthma. No drug allergies. Dyslipidaemia. No other known cardiovascular risk factors. Bronchial asthma. Affective disorder. On treatment with lorazepam 1 mg/24h, simvastatin 10 mg/24h, montelukast 10 mg/24h and salmeterol/fluticasone 25/250 mcg/12h.

History, current illness and physical examination
The patient was referred to the Cardiology Department from the Pneumology Department, where she was being seen for bronchial asthma, when a CT scan of the chest showed a malposition of the great arteries as a chance finding, for diagnosis of possible heart disease. She presented with wheezing and increased secretions related to influenza vaccination. She denied cardiac symptoms such as exertional dyspnoea, angina, palpitations or syncope. Physical examination: Conscious, oriented, cooperative. Good general condition. Well hydrated and perfused. Eupneic at rest. No jugular ingurgitation. Rhythmic auscultation without murmurs. Disseminated wheezing. Symmetrical peripheral pulses present. No oedema.

Complementary tests
- ECG: Sinus rhythm at 63 bpm. Normal PR. Left axis. Intraventricular conduction disorder. Anomalous progression of R in right precordial leads.
- Chest X-ray: normal cardiothoracic index. Slight aortic elongation. Enlarged pulmonary hilum.
- CT scan: anomalous arrangement of great vessels, with pulmonary artery medial to the aorta (aortic overlap or corrected transposition?). Pulmonary cone slightly increased in size (radiological pulmonary hypertension). Mosaic pattern of pulmonary parenchyma of vascular cause.
- Echocardiography: Situs solitus. Ventricular inversion. Atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance. Left ventricle of normal size and contractility. Left atrium of normal size. Right chambers of normal size and function. Right AV valve without alterations. Left AV valve with moderate insufficiency.
- Cardiac MRI: Situs solitus. Ventriculoarterial discordance. Aorta seating in the right ventricle and pulmonary in the left ventricle. Atrioventricular discordance. Anterior and left aorta in relation to the pulmonary aorta. Ventricular inversion. Systemic ventricle with increased volumes and function at the limit of normality. Subpulmonary ventricle with reduced volume and normal contractility. Aortic valve with mild regurgitation. Systemic AV valve with dilatation of the annulus, good opening and two jets of moderate central regurgitation. Pulmonary valve without alterations. Severely dilated trunk and main pulmonary branches justified by pulmonary hypertension

Clinical evolution
The patient was assessed at the Cardiology Department, where an ECG and echocardiography were performed and a cardiac MRI was requested to confirm the diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries; in addition, moderate systemic AV valve insufficiency with pulmonary hypertension was detected. He started treatment with furosemide 40 mg/24h and remained in good functional grade I/IV NYHA at successive check-ups. He continues to be reviewed by pulmonology and cardiology without the appearance of rhythm disorders or worsening of the severity of the valvulopathies or the appearance of ventricular dysfunction by echocardiography. No other therapeutic measures are currently being considered.

Diagnosis
- Transposition of the great arteries, congenitally corrected
- Moderate systemic AV-valve insufficiency
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Bronchial asthma
