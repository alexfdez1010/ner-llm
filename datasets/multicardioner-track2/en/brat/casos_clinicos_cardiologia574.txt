77-year-old male seen in cardiology outpatient clinic, visit 1 after admission for acute myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation Killip I; attention is drawn to poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.


HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

History
No drug allergies. Independent for basic activities of daily living. Smoker 15 cigarettes a day until the date of the infarction (he reports that after admission he started smoking again but now only smokes 5 cigarettes a day). Diabetes mellitus type 2 for 22 years, insulin-dependent, dyslipidaemia, hypertension. Chronic kidney disease with usual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 47 ml/min/1.7m2. History of lumbar malignant melanoma resected 10 years ago without relapse. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (prostatectomy 10 years ago). Usual treatment on admission: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg/24 h, bisoprolol 5 mg/12 h, insulin glargine 52 IU/24 h, metformin+sitagliptin 1000+50 mg/24-12 h, gembifrozil 900 mg/24 h, omeprazole 20 mg/24 h. Patient admitted for acute myocardial infarction on 08/09/2020, with symptoms of typical chest pain without dyspnoea or signs of heart failure. The electrocardiogram (ECG), in sinus rhythm at 60 bpm, showed negative T in V3-V4, which was positive on discharge, with a peak Tn of 11051. The admission blood test showed basal glucose 133, creatinine 1.20, cholesterol 185 mg/dl, HDL 34 mg/dl, LDL 107 mg/dl, triglycerides 219 mg/dl, Hb glycated 7.1%. Coronary catheterisation showed anterior descending artery (AD) of good calibre and extension with critical lesion in proximal-middle third and long plaque with significant stenosis in middle third that conditions TIMI 1 distal flow; non-dominant circumflex artery (Cx) with minimal non-significant plaque in middle third and very distal borderline plaque with scarce distal field at that level and normal distal flow; dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with minimal proximal non-significant plaque and distal irregularity. Primary angioplasty with implantation of two drug-eluting stents in the proximomedial LAD and mid LAD. Echocardiography was performed compatible with ischaemic heart disease and normal LVEF (report attached).

Examination revealed a systolic murmur II/VI in the aortic focus and grade I obesity (weight 103 kg, height 183 cm, body mass index [BMI] 30.75) with abdominal circumference 112 cm.

Treatment at hospital discharge: omeprazole 20 g/24 h, ASA 100 mg/24 h, ticagrelor 90 mg/24 h, bisoprolol 2.5 mg/24 h, rosuvastatin-ezetimibe 20-10 mg/24 h, insulin glargine 52 IU/24 h and metformin-sitagliptin 1000-50 mg/12 h.


COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Admission blood tests: creatinine 1.25 (GFR 58 ml/min /1.73 m2), cholesterol 185 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 34 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 107 mg/dl, triglycerides 219 mg/dl, glycated haemoglobin 7.1%.
Coronary catheterisation: coronary catheterisation showed a good calibre and extension LAD with critical lesion in the proximal-middle third and long plaque with significant stenosis in the middle third that conditions distal flow TIMI 1; non-dominant Cx with minimal non-significant plaque in the middle third and very distal borderline plaque with scant distal field at that level and normal distal flow; dominant DC with minimal proximal non-significant plaque and distal irregularity.
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE): moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) septal sigmoid septum, strict apical and apical septal akinesia and mid-septal-anterior segment hypokinesia. Normal global LVEF. Normal aortic valve (AoV) and mitral valve (MV). Grade I diastolic dysfunction. Normal left atrium (LA). Right ventricle (RV) of normal size and function. No tricuspid insufficiency (TI). Signs of normal central venous pressure (CVP). No pericardial effusion. Aortic root of normal size. No intracardiac masses.
Laboratory tests: glycated haemoglobin 8.2%, haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl, total cholesterol 92 mg/dl, HDL 36 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 17.13 mg/dl.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
On being seen at our clinic, the patient reported no new chest pains, gradual return to normal physical activity with slight dyspnoea on moderate exertion, which he attributed to physical deconditioning. She has gained 3 kg (current weight 106 kg, BMI 31.7). In control laboratory tests, glycated haemoglobin 8.2%, haemoglobin 11.8 g/dl, total cholesterol 92 mg/dl, HDL 36 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol 17.13 mg/dl. Dulaglutide 0.75 mg subcutaneous every 7 days was started and increased to 1.5 mg/7 days if well tolerated. Contact was made with primary care and clinical control was scheduled with daily glycaemic self-monitoring for possible adjustment of the insulin regimen and to check tolerance to the drug. Control with blood tests and iron studies in 6 months.

DIAGNOSIS
Acute myocardial infarction without ST Killip I elevation (preserved LVEF).
Significant coronary artery disease of a main vessel.
Type II insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with poor metabolic control.
Obesity grade I.
Smoking.
Dyslipidaemia.
Chronic kidney disease.
