26-year-old male, who attended his point of continuous care in the early hours of the morning due to vomiting and agitation, accompanied by pain in the left rib cage with coughing since the middle of the night.

History, current illness and physical examination
Personal history: Male, 26 years old. Allergy to penicillin. Previous history of drug intoxication.
Usual treatment: No. Present illness: This is a 26-year-old male, who came to his point of continuous care in the early hours of the morning with vomiting and agitation, accompanied by pain in the left rib cage with cough since the middle of the night (4-5 am). Given the patient's condition, it was decided to transfer him to his regional referral hospital. He denied the use of toxic substances and cocaine.
Physical examination: BP 92/62 mmHg HR 71 bpm. Conscious, agitated, anxiety, pallor, sweating. Signs of poor peripheral perfusion. Cardiac auscultation showed no murmurs or evidence of heart failure.

Complementary tests
- CBC: Haemogram: Leukocytes: 27,900/ml (N 89%; L 5.6%), Hb 17.3 g/dl, Hct 48.9%, platelets 400,000 /ml. Basic biochemistry: Glucose 187 mg/dl; urea 30 mg/dl; creatinine 1.2 mg/dl; Na 143 meq/l, K 3.7 meq/l. Myocardial damage markers: TpI 0.03. Coagulation: PT 99; aPTT 23.3. - Urine toxicity: cocaine, benzodiazepines and cannabinoid products.
- Chest X-ray: No acute pleuropulmonary pathology.
- Initial electrocardiogram: Sinus rhythm 60 bpm. ST-segment elevation > 2 mm in the anterolateral side.
- Electrocardiogram 2: Sinus rhythm 80 bpm. In view of the clinical findings (chest pain, signs of poor peripheral perfusion; preshock K status) and electrocardiographic findings (AMI with ST-segment elevation) and given that the patient was in a regional hospital with no possibility of early access to a centre with primary angioplasty, it was decided to perform thrombolysis with 8000 IU of metalyse. However, after thirty minutes there were no clinical or electrocardiographic criteria for reperfusion, so it was decided to transfer the patient to a reference centre for primary PTCA.
At the start of the transfer, the patient presented good saturation and data of capillary hypoperfusion with a capillary refill time > 2 seconds. During the transfer he presented episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and slow ventricular tachycardia.
After 20 minutes he presented with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and advanced CPR manoeuvres were initiated. After 30 minutes, asystole was observed and advanced CPR manoeuvres were continued. He arrived at the haemodynamics room of our centre in asystole, an urgent echocardiogram was performed which showed no evidence of cardiac rupture and after 50 minutes of unsuccessful advanced CPR, the patient died.

Diagnosis
- Acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation due to cocaine use.
- Exitus.
