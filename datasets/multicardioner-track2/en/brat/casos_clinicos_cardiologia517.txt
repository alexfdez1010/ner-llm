HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

History
46-year-old male patient. No cardiovascular risk factors. No known personal cardiological history. No marfanoid habit. Diagnosed with discoid lupus under treatment. Father died of aortic dissection in 2010 at the age of 61, with no history of hypertension or marfanoid habit. Trivalve aortic valve. Two healthy children.

Current disease
In view of the father's history, our patient and his sister were referred for a study in 2010. At that time the patient had an aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva of 39 mm, dilated for his body surface, a trivalve aortic valve and no stigma of Marfan or other syndromic entities, so it was decided to follow up. During the follow-up, a progressive growth of the aortic root was observed. In March 2017, an angio-CT scan was completed, confirming a 46 mm aorta.  Physical examination Height 1.80 m, weight 72 kg, BP 105/59 mmHg (symmetrical in both upper limbs), HR 80 bpm, SatO2 98% on room air. Normal phenotype. CBC: no jugular ingurgitation. Cardiac auscultation: rhythmic, no audible murmurs. Pulmonary auscultation: no superimposed sounds. Abdomen: nondescript. EIA: no malleolar oedema.

COMPLEMENTARY TESTS
Echocardiogram in September 2014: LV not dilated or hypertrophic with normal systolic function. Diastolic pattern of prolonged relaxation. Dilatation of the aortic root with effacement of the sino-tubular junction. Maximum diameter of 43 mm. Aortic root dilatation with normal systolic function. Normofunctioning MV. Normal right chambers. Echocardiogram in September 2016: LA of normal size. LV of normal dimensions, without alterations in segmental contractility and with normal systolic function. Normal filling pressures. Normofunctioning MV. AoV trivalva normofunctioning. RV of normal size and function, without adequate signal for PSAP calculation. Dilated aortic root of 46 mm. No pericardial effusion. Normal vena cava. Analysis: biochemistry: Glc 92 mg/dl. Urea 36 mg/dl. Creatinine 0.95 mg/dl. Na 144 mmol/l. K 4.5 mmol/L, FA 68 U/l. AST 16 U/l. ALT 18 U/l. GGT 22 U/. Haemogram: Hb 14.2 g/dl. Haematocrit 44 %. Leukocytes 6,520/uL with 57 % neutrophils. Platelets 245.000/uL. PT coagulation 86 %. INR 1.11. Fibrinogen 397.
Angio-CT of aorta and coronary arteries: trivalve aortic valve. No alterations are observed in the origin of the coronary arteries. The aortic root measures 29.5 x 23.5 mm at the valve annulus, 46 x 42 mm at the sinuses of Valsalva and 40 x 37 mm at the sinotubular junction. The ascending aorta measures 41 x 37.5 mm. The proximal portion of the aortic arch measures 30.5 x 30 mm, the medial portion 28.5 x 25.5 mm and the isthmus 25.5 x 23.5 mm. The descending aorta at the level of the diaphragmatic pillars measures 22 x 20.5 mm. Normal origin of coronary arteries. Coronary arteries without lesions.

EVOLUTION
Given the angio-CT findings and measurements together with the family history, once syndromic entities had been ruled out, the patient was framed in the context of aneurysm syndrome and family dissections, and was referred to Cardiac Surgery for surgery. The patient was admitted on a scheduled basis for aortic root and ascending aorta replacement with a 34 mm tube with aortic valve reimplantation according to David's technique. Immediate postoperative evolution was favourable, with no notable incidents or complications. The post-surgery echocardiogram showed a 33 mm aortic root with correct valve function. The anatomopathological study of the aortic fragment analysed showed a thinned elastic lamina with myxoid degeneration of the media. Finally, the patient was discharged home, pending the results of the genetic study requested.

DIAGNOSIS
Ascending aortic aneurysm in an asymptomatic patient with a history of aortic dissection in a first-degree relative. Surgery for aortic root replacement and ascending aorta.
