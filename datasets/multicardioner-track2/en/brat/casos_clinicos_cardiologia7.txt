HISTORY, CURRENT ILLNESS AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with no known drug allergies. As cardiovascular risk factors, she has recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus under dietary treatment and smokes half a pack a day. She had no previous cardiological history and had undergone parathyroidectomy. The patient was referred to the emergency department of our centre from her health centre due to headache, pulsating frontal headache related to hypertensive emergency, as well as dyspnoea on moderate exertion in the last few weeks. She denied chest pain, dizziness or other cardiovascular symptoms. Physical examination on arrival at the ED showed blood pressure (BP) 180/100, heart rate (HR) 74 bpm. Conscious, oriented, cooperative. Neurological examination within normal limits. Normal jugular venous pulse. Rhythmic heart sounds with systolic murmur II/VI predominantly in the mesocardium and with preserved S2. Pulmonary, abdominal and lower limb auscultation without relevant alterations.

ECOCARDIOGRAM (admission) (videos 1-3) Left atrium (LA) slightly dilated. Left ventricle (LV) with severe concentric hypertrophy (21 mm approximately at septal level, 15 mm in relation to PP), without asynergies and with preserved systolic function. Prolonged diastolic relaxation pattern (type 1 diastolic dysfunction). A subvalvular gradient of approx. 22 mmHg is obtained in relation to prominent septal knee, due to flow acceleration at this level (no SAM and no subaortic membrane). Normofunctioning mitral valve. Trivalve aortic valve with good opening without significant stenosis or insufficiency. Right ventricle (RV) with preserved function, without adequate signal for calculation of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PSAP). No pericardial effusion. No significant gradient at the level of the descending aorta. Normal vena cava.
CORONARYGRAPHY: right dominance. Coronary arteries without significant angiographic lesions.
ECOCARDIOGRAM (outpatient, 5 months after discharge) (video 4): LV of normal size and thickness, without alterations of segmental contractility and preserved systolic function. Normal diastolic pattern for age. RV of normal size and function. Mild mitral insufficiency. Mild-moderate tricuspid insufficiency that allows estimating a PSAP of 24 mmHg + PVC.
Laboratory tests at the clinic: LDL cholesterol 100 mg/dl, HbA1c 6.5%.
Cardiac NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (MRI) (outpatient after control echocardiography): LV and RV images were obtained in cine sequences, Stir and late enhancement after gadolinium administration. LV: normal size, with VTD of 64 ml/m2 (range 41-81 ml/m2) and STV of 18 ml/m2 (range 12-21 ml/m2). EF 71%, cardiac output 5.4 l/min and stroke volume 88 ml. Normal segmental contractility. Normal myocardial mass of 65 g/m2 (range 63-95 g/m2). Maximum septal thickness of 12 mm. No myocardial oedema on STIR sequence. No pathological contrast uptake suggesting areas of fibrosis, signs of infiltrative cardiomyopathy or other findings. RV: normal size, without morphological alterations, with TVD of 62 ml/m2 (range 48-87 ml/m2) and STV of 24 ml/m2 (range 11-28 ml/m2). EF 61%, cardiac output 4.5 l/min and stroke volume 72.5 ml. Contractility normal. Left atrium (LA): area 19 cm2, normal size. Right atrium (RA): area 19 cm2, normal size. Aortic root flow quantification (phase contrast velocity coding). Anterograde volume 78 ml and retrograde volume 2.35 ml. Regurgitation fraction 3%. Peak velocity 155 cm/s. Pressure gradient 9.6 mmHg. Quantification of main pulmonary artery flow (phase contrast velocity coding). Antegrade volume 83 ml and retrograde volume 1.6 ml. Regurgitation fraction 1.9%. Peak velocity 107 cm/s. Pressure gradient 4.5 mmHg. Pericardium: no significant pericardial thickening or effusion. Conclusions: LV of normal size and function. No significant hypertrophy (maximum thickness 12 mm) and no evidence of infiltrative cardiomyopathy.

CLINICAL EVOLUTION
Electrocardiogram and laboratory tests were performed with markers of myocardial damage (creatine kinase and ultrasensitive troponin T) with elevation of these markers. In view of these findings and with the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) type 2 in the context of hypertensive emergency, admission was decided for adjustment of treatment and completion of studies. An echocardiogram was performed showing severe concentric hypertrophy causing a dynamic gradient at the LV outflow tract and a complete serological study, given the recent onset of symptoms, in order to try to exclude a possible infectious origin, which was negative, as well as coronary angiography, given the mobilisation of markers of myocardial damage without evidence of significant angiographic lesions. The patient progressed favourably after starting antihypertensive treatment with a combination of olmesartan, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide (40/5/12.5mg) and beta-blocker (bisoprolol 2,5mg), so in view of the results it was decided to discharge him home and a possible diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or hypertensive heart disease with severe left ventricular hypertrophy was established, and to try to establish the differential diagnosis, an outpatient cardiac MRI was requested. Simultaneously, treatment was started with metformin 850 mg/12 hours and rosuvastatin 20 mg every 24 hours, based on the results of the analytical controls. Three months after discharge, she visited the cardiology outpatient clinic for a check-up. She required a progressive decrease in antihypertensive medication and at the time of consultation was treated with amlodipine 5 mg and bisoprolol 2.5 mg with optimal control of BP and ambulatory values maintained at around 120/60 mmHg. The physical examination revealed that the systolic murmur that had been present on admission had disappeared, so it was decided to request an ABPM that confirmed optimal control of BP and an echocardiogram with normalisation of wall thicknesses and no other relevant alterations.
Finally, cardiac MRI was performed, showing a LV of normal size and thickness with no evidence of pathological gadolinium uptake, either early or late, so structural heart disease was ruled out and a definitive diagnosis of resolved myocarditis was established.

DIAGNOSIS
Acute myocarditis in resolution. Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Hypercholesterolemia type dyslipidaemia. Newly diagnosed arterial hypertension (AHT).
